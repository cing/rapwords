Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Jay-Z
Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe (Remix)
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar + female singer]
I am a sinner, who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me, things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone.. bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music, I would share it but today 
I'm yellin' "Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my VIBE; bitch, don't kill my vibe"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Hol' up - Trinidad James in four weeks but now my album platinum and shit
So what? Y'all keep the numbers 
I'm more than another statistic, my nigga, this courtesy of Compton (courtesy of Compton)
Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker, love me on the east like I'm Chuck D, dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin to be the God MC, you look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there - I'm fuckin this industry hard
I'm baggin this money, tea-baggin your honey, you'd thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're lightweight, they tell me you nice and I'm like "wait!"
Go get me a knife, you're lookin like steak" and when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And where the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher but we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase, I know you heard me nigga, this is a burpee nigga
Lyrical exercise, right now homie, I'm in extra vibe
Pipe down on the curve when you heard that I got these words to the upper echelon, that's excell-ant

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Up in the clouds, me and my spouse..
Rumors on the ground gettin too loud, please turn them shits down (down, DOWN...)
Can't hear myself think, turbulence, shit, I almost spilled my drink
In the White House with a mink, runnin through that bitch like it's my house, all up in the hall like a mall
Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball, no I don't 'member you, I don't intend to 
empty my, memory, bank, it's a +Million Dollars+ in it, +Baby+, Hilary Swank
Sittin next to Hilary smellin like dank, presidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him
I'll WAIT... {*echoes*} ...
I've been in my wave like twenty years straight, I've been on my vibe like twenty years straight
Don't fuck up my high (fuck up my high) nights like this, I could fuck up a pie and still be skraight (still be skraight) 
Fall back bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath.. I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint {*inhales*} smokin' this shit like I'm tryna prove a point
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno, kill my, vibe, that's your motherfuckin funeral {*laughs*}

[Kendrick Lamar]
Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggaz pissed off
I'm in this lil' 'dition shit, envision my fort
Leader of the new school, on my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be +Black Swan+?
World in my palms, ironically, I am the Globetrotters' best cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was 16 that I'd write a 16 to put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with 16, should have been in the pen but now my pen writin' with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends, I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was runnin for dear life but now I'm runnin the map, bitch, I'm here NIGGA~!
Picture little old me givin a fuck from what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or hit a Suburban, nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent but I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose
Like BLAP! Mini-14 like BLAP! Empty out another magazine like BLAP!
Hit a young nigga, get BACK! (DOO!) I kill 'em all when they try to kill my VIBE! (DOO! DOO!)
I am the bad, the good guy, the last the hood got, the last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a ten second drum solo, bitch see you at Woodstock, AH!</pre>
