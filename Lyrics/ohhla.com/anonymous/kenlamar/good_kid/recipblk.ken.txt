Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Black Hippy
Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   The Recipe (Black Hippy Remix) *
Typed by: kill4747@hotmail.com

* Available only on the Spotify Deluxe Edition

[Sample from "Meet The Frownies" by Twin Sister]
"Smoking weed with you
cause you've taught me to…"  - - > Andrea Estella (*Repeats throughout the entire song*) 

[Ab-Soul] 
Fuck Black Hippy, nigga
I invented the recipe

It's a beautiful day, I guess
For a bitch to roll with Ab-Soul, I guess
Pretty chick, let me see them breasts
E.T. OG from the weed clinic (Soulo!)
Solo, but I'm never alone (That's right)
I stay high and I'm powerful (Soulo!)
Westside! (Easy call) 
I got three eyes, man, I see y'all
All I do is kill shit, ICU
Party with a few girls at USC
It's eight-two degrees and my top off, and they top off
I'm getting topped off… (Soul!) Top Dawg
Women, weed, and weather, what more can I say?
"To live and die in LA"
"Spend a week on Venice Beach"
I'm 2Pac AND Biggie Smalls
 
[ScHoolboy Q]
Every mornin', nigga, I get blazed, aye (Yeah!)
Women, weed, and weather, nigga, if you bored, come and join the wave, aye (Yeah!)
Girl, what is your name? Cause I'm feeling your frame, can I see what you ‘bout? Uh!
A little somethin' in your rear, little somethin' in your mouth 
little somethin' on your couch, uh! Know what I'm talkin' about? 
Bring the coffin out
Cause I killed it, I done drilled it
She said she like it from the back like a real bitch, uh!
She swallowed my pride, I damn near cried
Yo, I can't reply, she curled my toes and crossed my eyes
but when you got the recipe, it's no surprise
Bad hoes panties get left behind, I want your behind and…
 
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Dr. Dre)
You might catch me in Atlanta lookin' like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-town, I be really pimpin'
but nothin' like my hometown, I'm forever livin'
Women, weed and weather
(They come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA
 
[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some… 
three W's only for a three day run, bitch!
Take them motherfuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit!
I be livin' in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
"Ribbon in the Sky" on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California livin' 'till I am old
You want to be on to peak on the chart
so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon cause she on the BS before we can start, uh!

Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know I'm priority 
Order me Hennessy and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy, he on his job, boy, he sure be havin' the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale the pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controllin' my vice
No way, hell no, uh-uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be on to peak on the chart
so the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
that it's eight-two degrees and my top peeled off
 
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Dr. Dre)
You might catch me in Atlanta lookin' like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-town, I be really pimpin'
but nothin' like my hometown, I'm forever livin'
Women, weed and weather
(They come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to…
 
[Jay Rock]
Jay Rock got the recipe, fly hoes wanna roll, I guess (I guess)
Everybody know I got that yola (yola), ask Keisha, she'll confess (Huh!)
I wake up, then I bake up with a bad bitch, she ain't got on no make up, uh!
Medicated, geez, my nigga, no tellin' where the high gonna take us, uh
Three w's, I'm at The W, she got double D's ‘bout to bring trouble through
OG, Hennessy get their panties wet, I'm tryin' to +dive in the swimmin' pool+
Left stroke, right stroke, what's the best stroke?
That stroke can smoke all down her throat
and we blows all kinds of dro
Cali got the best so act like you know, nigga!
 
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Dr. Dre)
You might catch me in Atlanta lookin' like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-town, I be really pimpin'
But nothin' like my hometown I'm forever livin'
Women, weed and weather
(They come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA (*Echoes*)</pre>
