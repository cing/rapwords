Artist: Kendrick Lamar
Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   Swimming Pool (Drank) (Extended)
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro/Interlude]
Pour up (drank) head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank) stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank) wake up (drank)
Faded (drank) faded (drank)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
that I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd move
Changin' by the minute, and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Interlude]

[Kendrick Lamar]
"Okay, now open your mind up and listen to me Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me then you will be history Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now, and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick"
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice, then apparently
I'm over-influenced by what you are doin', I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Kendrick Lamar - repeat 2X]
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one-hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you, bang?
Two chopper, two-hundred shots, bang

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Kendrick Lamar]
{"Sherane..."}
Pool full of liquor then you dive in, in, in, in {*reversed*}
{"Sherane, Sherane, Sherane..."}
W-watch 'em all f-flock (aww man) 
{"Sherane..."} Girls wanna play, play, play
(Where is she takin' me?)
P-pool full of liquor, I'ma d-i-i-iive in it
(Where is she takin', me?)

All I, all I, all I, all I, all I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane, tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
is in the bottom, of the bottle, and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release, everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep 
and never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough</pre>
