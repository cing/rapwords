Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro]
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit your bitch ass down and listen
to this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans
Ya bitch...

[Kendrick Lamar - singing] + (JMSN)
Smokin' on the finest dope, aye aye aye aye
Drank until I can't no more, aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a sober soul, but I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later, aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a peacemaker, but I'm with the homies right now
And momma used to say 
"One day it's gon' burn you out" (one, day, it's, gon', burn, you, out)
"One day it's gon' burn you out, out" (one, day, it's, gon', burn, you, out)
"One day it's gon' burn you out" (one, day, it's, gon', burn, you, out)
"One day it's gon' burn you" - I'm with the homies right now 
(One, day, it's, gon', burn, you, out)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
a flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate, if it’s necessary
Bumpin' Jeezy first album lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think is an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they working with
Look at me - I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I’m drug-free, but shit I'm with the homies

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga (me and the homies)
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up fo' and get twisted some mo' (me and the homies)
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in (me and the homies)
Matter fact, I hop out that mothafucka 
And be like "Doo doo doo doo! Doo doo doo doo doo!"

[Kendrick Lamar]
It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405 passin' Westchester
You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
Cause every time we down there we pullin' out the Boost Mobile sim cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn’t like then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger
I mean I was never stranger to the funk neither - I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That’s ironic cause I’ve never been violent, until I'm with the homies

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Just ridin', just ridin'... (me and the homies)
Bullshittin', actin' a fool... (me and the homies)
Trippin', really trippin'... (me and the homies)
Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin'

[Kendrick Lamar]
Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessey didn't make me feel that bad
I’m usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain’t got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin' 
And our attitude is still "Nigga, what is you sayin'?"
Pull in front of the house that we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want

[Break]
"Ay, ay, nigga cash out, pop the safe"
 "Ay nigga, I think it's somebody in this room"
"Wait, what?"
 "Nigga, it's somebody in this room!"

[Kendrick Lamar]
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma screen, TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called "Hello? What you doin'?" "Kickin' it"
I should've told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense with the homies...
But they made a right, they made a left, then made a right
Then another right; one lucky night with the homies</pre>
