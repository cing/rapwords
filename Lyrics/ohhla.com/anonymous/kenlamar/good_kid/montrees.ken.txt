Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Anna Wise, Jay Rock
Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   Money Trees
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, me and my niggas tryin' to get it, ya bish (ya bish)
Hit the house lick, tell me is you with it, ya bish? (ya bish)
Home invasion was persuasive (was persuasive)
From nine-to-five I know it's vacant, ya bish (ya bish)
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (wasn't cool)
I fucked Sherane then went to tell my bros (tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on (burn came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (ya bish)
Park the car then we start rhymin', ya bish (ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (see dollar signs)
You lookin' like an easy come up, ya bish (ya bish)
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish (ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (we never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue

[Chorus One: Kendrick Lamar + Anna Wise]
It go Halle Berry, or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun lives forever)
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel

[Chorus Two: Kendrick Lamar + Anna Wise]
Nah, nah; a dollar might just fuck your main bitch, that's just how I feel
Nah; a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with, that's just how I feel
Nah, nah; a dollar might, just make that lane switch, that's just how I feel
Nah; a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich, that's just how I feel

[Kendrick Lamar]
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (like rappers do)
Bump that new E-40 after school (after school)
You know "Big Ballin' with my Homies" (my homies)
Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational (thinkin' rational)
Back to reality we poor, ya bish (ya bish)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (ya bish)
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (Uncle Tony head)
He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish (ya bish)
That Louis Burger'll never be the same (be the same)
A Louis belt will never ease that pain (ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin' (Pirelli's skirtin')
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (ya bish)
Hopin' all of em offend you, ya bish (ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (a pot of gold)
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Interlude 2X: Anna Wise]
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way
Hit the streets then we break the code? No way
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way

[Jay Rock]
Imagine Rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda, yola whippin', ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, everyday I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em, get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and got them bands just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurkin' blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

[Chorus One]</pre>
