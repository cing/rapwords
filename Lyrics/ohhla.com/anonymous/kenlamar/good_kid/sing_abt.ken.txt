Artist: Kendrick Lamar
Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   Sing About Me
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
When the lights shut off, and it's my turn
to settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off, and it's my turn
to settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow, I'm hopin' that I can borrow
a peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted, I find nothin' but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction or a reaction
of what we consider madness, I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering "Get 'em!"
I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n in pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes, it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope {*three gunshots*}

[Chorus] - minus first two lines

[Kendrick Lamar]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it "Section.80," the message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby"
What's crazy was I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well it's completely my future, her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that 40 dollars
Even if I gotta fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinglin' keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em back
to where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet a leader, you need her to learn something
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted but fuck that "sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryin' to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? I'll wait
.. Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
{*fading*} You lyin' to these motherfuckers, talkin' about you can help 'em
With my story, you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away? It it's today I hope I hear a
cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
rake in the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon and if I'm doomed
May the wound help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot and every day the glass mirror
Get tougher to watch, I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
in a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told"
Cursin' the life of 20 generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continued rappin'
Or steady being distracted by money, drugs, and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it? ..
Did I put enough work in? ..

[Chorus] - minus first two lines

[female singer - repeat 4X]
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for, ooohhh...</pre>
