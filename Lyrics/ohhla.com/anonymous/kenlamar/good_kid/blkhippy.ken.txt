Artist: Kendrick Lamar
Album:  good kid, m.A.A.d city
Song:   Swimming Pools (Black Hippy Remix) (Bonus Track)
Typed by: Hdub

[Intro]
Playas always tryin to pop bottles
Niggas love to pop bottles
Man get you a table my nigga
Go get you a table my nigga

Pour up (drank) Head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank) stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank) wake up (drank)
Faded (drank) faded (drank)

[Jay Rock]
No syrup in this cup but this the pour up
When you see me pour up
Turn up 'til you throw up
Like a bulimic fiendin for hurl over them toilets
If I run outta liquor in yo' city yo where the store at?
One bottle two bottles I'm a soldier never sober
Cup runneth over don't give a fuck bout Cirrhosis
One life that's all we have ok let's toast to that
Then dive in a pool full of liquor
Swim laps like Michael Phelps

[Chorus]
Nigga why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'm a show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I gotta swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'm a dive in it
Pour up (drank) Head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank) stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank) wake up (drank)
Faded (drank) faded (drank)

[Ab-Soul]
(Yeah) Used to wake up every morning to a glass of Alize
Hope this dollar shot of E&J'll take the pain away
Aim and shoot, shots of Ciroc'll make the girls get loose wit it
We all trippin off that Henn like a female chicken (You wit it?)
Yeah spread yo wings you probably won't get far
I honestly wouldn't advise operating a car
Try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya
End up giving it up in the restroom like the rest of 'em

[Chorus]

[ScHoolBoy Q]
So it's that groovy little nigga known for poppin them bottles
Under my pants be a golden dead bitch
Everything about me solid
Burberry nigga them be my drawers
Alexander McQueen in closets
Swagged Out Ken yeah nigga I'm Puff uhh
Have that pussy throbbin' 
Someone tell me where the drugs at
I'm into that twistin' off them molly caps
Ciroc dude don't fuck with Goose
Can I get a shot swim in ya juice?
Worth a stack a minute everyday that shit repeat
I ain't trying to sweep you off ya feet
Here til ya see ya travesty now

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
All I all I all I all I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me make an excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything
that corrodes inside of me 
I see you joke and while you laugh don't you feel bad
I'll probably sleep and never ever wake up
never ever wake up never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

More more bloody more we gon' drink this muhfucka down
More bottoms up then we pass it round more
Fill it up more, not enough more
Bloody more we gon drink this muhfucka down more
Bottoms up then we pass it round more
Fill it up more, not enough more
Fill it up more, not enough more
Fill it up more, not enough more</pre>
