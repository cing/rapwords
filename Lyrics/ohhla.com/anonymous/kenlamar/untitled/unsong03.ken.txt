[Kendrick Lamar] + (Anna Wise)
(What did the Asian say?) A peace of mind
That's what the Asian said, I need a divine
intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believin' in Buddha, me believin' in God
Asked him "What are you doin'?", he said "Takin' my time
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinkin' too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?"
(What did the Indian say?) A piece of land
That's what the Indian said, I needed demand
Tellin' me longevity's in the dirt, should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed
(Now what the black man say?) A piece of pussy
That's what the black man said I needed to push me
to the limit to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from haircut to a wool, we like to live in the jungle
Like to play in the peach, what you sayin' to me?
He said "Nigga come back to reality for a week"
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it
(What the white man say?) A piece of mine's
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Tellin' me that he sellin' me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rappin', I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losin' your core followin' gainin' it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
Look at what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
I'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist, if I don't target your market
If you ain't signin' your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are givin' their demo all in the toilet
You work toward your master's mortgage
I need a piece

[Chorus 2X: Bilal]
I holler, "What you DO? What you SAY?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today</pre>
