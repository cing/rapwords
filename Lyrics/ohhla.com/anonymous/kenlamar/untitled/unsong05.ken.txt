{*instrumental plays on for 57 seconds*}

[Chorus: Anna Wise]
Somebody said you, bumped your head and, bled the floor
Jumped into a, pit of flames and, burned to coal
Drowned inside the, lake outside, away you flow...
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world toooo me
And that means the world to me

[Kendrick Lamar]
Somebody said you, bumped your head and, bled the floor
Jumped into a, pit of flames and, burned to coal
Drowned inside the, lake outside, away you flow
And this I know

I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my trunk
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular, I'm drunk
How can I can make them popular? Pop 'em when I want
See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety
Fuckin' up the system, I ain't fuckin' with society
Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time, I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinkin' by myself at the intersection parked
Watched you when you walked inside your house, you threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creepin' through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
every piece of your brain 'til your son jumped in your arms
Cut on the engine then sped off in the rain, I'm gone

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Drove alone with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle

[Punch]
Lit off Henny, I'm tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble
Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel
Wait, that's a bit ambitious, maybe I'm trippin'
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes, I see the distance
It's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God but still don't recognize my flaws
I guess I'm lost, the cost of bein' successful
is equal to bein' neglectful, I pray my experience helps you
As for me, I'm tryna sort it out
Searchin' for loopholes in my bruised soul but who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key so I am king

[Anna Wise]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (ahh)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (ahh, ahh, ahh)

[Kendrick Lamar]
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is Father Time
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind
I know that I'm intelligence, my confidence just died

[Jay Rock]
Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise
A tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets, they seein' me as I pacify
But couldn't fathom the meanin' of seein' sacrifice

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm passin' lives on a daily, maybe I'm losin' faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake

[Jay Rock]
I'm sleep walkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm out of place
Reinforcin' this heat barkin', these are the brakes
Before I blink, do I see me before them pearly gates?
Or this is just a mirage or a facade? Wait</pre>
