Pimp pimp~! (Hooray! Hooray!)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Love won't get you high as this, drugs won't get you high as this
Fame won't get you high as this, chains won't get you high as this
Juice won't get you high as this, crew won't get you high as this
Hate won't get you high as this, levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate
Uhh...
Love won't get you high as this, drugs won't get you high as this
Fame won't get you high as this, chains won't get you high as this
Juice won't get you high as this, levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate
Life won't get you high like this here, no, he won't get you high like this here, no
She won't get you high like this here, no, "For Free?" won't get you high like this here, no
Two ki's won't get you high, no no no, Bentleys won't get you high like no
... Levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate
Life won't get you high, no no no, he won't get you high, no, no, no
She won't get you high, no no no, "For Free?" won't get you high, no no no
Two ki's won't get you high, no no no, Bentleys won't get you high, no no no
My bars won't get you high, no no no, levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate
Shut your fuckin' mouth and get some cash, you bitch you
You be in your feelings, I be in my bag, you bitch you
Santa's reindeer better have some ass, you bitch you
Everythin' I'm workin', gotta be the gas, you bitch you
Shut your fuckin' mouth and get some cash, you bitch
You be in your feelings, I be in my bag, you bitch
Santa's reindeer better have some ass, you bitch
Everythin' I'm workin', gotta be the - levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate
Me don't want problems (me don't want problems) me don't want tricks (me don't want tricks)
Me do want dollars (me do want dollars) me want it big (me do want dollars)
Me don't want problems (we ride Impalas) me don't want tricks (me don't want tricks)
Me do want dollars (me don't want tricks) levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate
We don't want problems (we don't want problems) we don't want tricks (we don't want tricks)
We do want dollars (we do want dollars) we do it big (we don't want problems)
We do it big (we don't want problems) we do it big (we don't want tricks)
We don't want problems (we don't want problems) levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate

[Interlude]â€¨
Compton is where I'm from
Is where I'm from, where is I'm from

{*Part 2*}

[Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah yeah, young Egypt
Look look

I feel like Pacino in "Godfather", I'm charged
Our Father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous 'til I dealt with the consequence
The greatest and latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of makin' your choice and writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital
Avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies with batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid, just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar
on youth centers, buildings and Beamers and blue leather
Forecasted my future, this is the future
The mastermind until my next album, more power to you {*gunshot*}

{*Part 3*}

[Kendrick Lamar]
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on

[Interlude]
This is a fifteen minute song (ahahahah)
We're just jammin' out, we on stage
Taz, we just jammin' out
Hundred thousand (ah yeah, aww shit)
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it
Look look look, go back to the down note
They all sing this shit, everybody

[Kendrick Lamar - singing]
Now I don't let you down down for you'll see, you'll see, you'll see, you'll see
But I don't shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you, uhh
They say the government, ain't the truth, truth, truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth

But head is the answer, head is the future
Don't second guess yourself; come on, give me some help
Hey one more time band, I need y'all to help me out right now
Head is the answer, head is the future
It's the future, that nigga said
Don't second guess yourself; come on, give me some help
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, my background singer, come on, come on
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

I said, girl you make me wanna, uhh
Break this, the hoes screamin' now
Uhh, I said baby you make
You make me wanna just.. AHH~!!
Baby you got me speechless right now
{*ad-libs in the background*} (You gotta take it there)
I gotta take it there, I ain't even playin' no more, uhh

Said you just make me wanna Drake you, down to the, ground
To the, ground like, bam bam bam bam bam, ju-
You just make me wanna Drake you, down to the, ground
Off the, ground like, bam bam bam bam bam
And baby if your momma's around, if your momma's around
If your momma's around, if your momma's around
Tell her, tell her
No discrimination (hahahah!) she young nigga chasin'
And she can get this dick too!
I said - come on, come on, come on, come on, come on (hahahahah)
Come on - yeah nigga
You gotta do it, man (oh my god)
We gon' lay that shit
We gon' lay that shit, and watch what it's gon' do</pre>
