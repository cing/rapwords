Artist: Kendrick Lamar
Album:  #Section80
Song:   Fuck Your Ethnicity
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Intro]
Gather round, I'm glad everybody came out tonight
As we stand on our neighborhood corner
know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have
Listen, Keisha, Tammy, come up front
I recognize all of you, every creed and color
With that being said, fuck your ethnicity, you understand that?
We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you, all of you

Now everybody throw your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck throw your hands up high
Throw your hands up high

[Chorus]
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddamn it
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity nigga

[Kendrick Lamar]
Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it Hip Hop, I be calling it Hypnotize
Yeah, Hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind
What the fuck are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail, man I got so much in +store+
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga look at that line, it's so diverse
They getting off work and that wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benzs, and I been there, so I make it my business
to give 'em my full attention, ten-hut, man I gotta get my wind up
Man I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up, oooh
Matter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind the fucking cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone, I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it, I'm out of my mind
So don't you mind how much the cost it, penny for my thoughts
Everybody please hold up your wallets
Yeah man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell man?
Going postal, never freeze up when I approach you
That's star-struck, and roast you, oh my, HiiiPoWeR

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm tired of y'all, cause everybody lied to y'all
Do you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock of the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein, before calculus I was kicking in math
Dropping that science like an alchemist, and I be kicking that ass
Lyrically I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me I'ma come back with the head of alien
Don't alienate my dreams, get it right, get a life
I got two, that's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man I'm fly
Put wings on my back, that a plane or angel? Both
Like a pilot with a halo, whoa, gross

*sung*
I don't mean nothing, so many things come through
them, him, her, you, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
I'm just a messenger
Yeah I know life's a bitch, get the best of her

Put them threes up, they notice that we up
HiiiPoWeR, and the power, and the people, and if they don't believe us
they'll die
Wizard

[Chorus]</pre>
