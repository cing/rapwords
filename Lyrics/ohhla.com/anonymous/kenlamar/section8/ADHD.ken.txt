[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh-uh, fuck that

[Chorus]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half, wait nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Kendrick Lamar]
Man I swear, my nigga tripping off that shit again, pick him up, then I set him in
Cold water, then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope to take the pain away from the feeling that he feel today
You know when you're part of Section 8, and you feel like no one can relate
cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party tripping off, my generation sipping cough
syrup like it's water, never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, no wonder our lives is caught up in the daily superstition
that the world is bout to end, who gives a fuck? We never do listen
unless it comes with an 808, a melody and some hoes
PlayStation and some drank, technology bumping 'Soul
Looking around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
and they probably relatives, relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black, she black too
Purple label on her back, but that dap
is like when she take it straight to the head, then she look at me
She got A.D.H.D

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Like whoa-oh, whoa
Whoa-oh, whoa (I don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa-oh, whoa (I don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa-oh, whoa (They always told me A.D.H.D did it)
Whoa-oh

And then she started...
And then she started feeling herself like no one else in this apartment
Beg your pardon how I rap baby, how old are you?
She say twenty-two, I say twenty-three, ok then we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that? She said where my drink at?
I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors, have the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds, closed the screen, JumboTron
Made to the back where she reside, then she said read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
and the fact that she might just open up when the new flow start to drown
Her body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothing we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound
of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me, then looked
at it, then she grabbed it, then she said get it, understood?
You know why we crack babies, because we born in the eighties
That A.D.H.D crazy

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Like whoa-oh, whoa
Whoa-oh, whoa (I don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa-oh, whoa (I don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa-oh, whoa (They always told me A.D.H.D did it)
Whoa-oh

*sung*
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
