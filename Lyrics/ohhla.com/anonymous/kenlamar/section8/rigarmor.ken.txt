Artist: Kendrick Lamar
Album:  #Section80
Song:   Rigamortis
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
Alright here we go, third take
{*clears throat*} Real quick Ali, mm

[Chorus 1]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic
I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yessir
(Amen) Chuuch
(He dead) I killed him
(Amen) Bitch

[Kendrick Lamar]
And this is riga-mortis
and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus
The Matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit
You an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme
If you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin
and then I end on cloud nine
And that's important when you morph
into an angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures
My listeners reply
and tell me that you biting style
You got a hell of an appetite
And I'ma be here for a while
Just buckle up before the ride
or knuckle up if you could fight
We always making them duck or die
A suit and a tie is suitable
and usual, it's suicide
CSI just might investigate
this fucking parasite

(He dead)
(Amen)

That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity
This is studio felony
Feragami so many
and cool enough for the seventies
Nigga, payback's a bitch
and bitch you been living in debt with me
That I'm more than especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail
to say he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant
Rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody
Couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q
It's just me, Jay Rock, 'Soul and Q
So the system ain't why we cute
Nothing else you can do

[Chorus 2]
(He dead) Yep, yep
(Amen) I killed him
(He dead) {*laughs*}
(Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yep, yep
(Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure
(Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

[Kendrick Lamar]
I rapped him and made him Casper
I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya
I'll pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners
Won't you send us to bible study faster?
Your hypocrite is reaction of blasphemy
I assassin my casualty
and it's casually done
And tell 'em my salary come
in lumps of a hundreds
Don't talk to me bout no money
The sun is under my feet
and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you'd rather leap
My statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest street
and I get busy on many emcees
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody done see
some persistence, recognize I be
really too vicious, the permanent beast
and the demolition breaking up the streets
Better partition, better dot you T
and I gon' mention, how the fog you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching, getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
and I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
is star-struck, and the audacity
of y'all fucks, never could hassle me
and y'all luck, just ran out, you'll see

[Chorus 3]
(He dead) Yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure
(Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yep, yep
(Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure
(Amen) Amen</pre>
