Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Ashtro Bot
Album:  #Section80
Song:   Keisha's Song (Her Pain)
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Chorus: Ashtro Bot]
Fancy girls, on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She takes the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumping "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yelling at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
The seven cars start honking, she start running
like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
Just give all to her daddy, but she don't know her father, that's ironic
See a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
and it's quite simple, her castle is bout to be destroyed
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Undercovers and dummies that look like decoys
Remember sergeant let her slide
Said if he seen what's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise
she took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
she suddenly realized she'll never escape the allure
of the black man, white man, needing satisfaction
At first it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her
This motherfucker is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing
through that block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder, left her dead, raped in the street
Keisha's song

Mm, my little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
the day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play

[Chorus: 2X]</pre>
