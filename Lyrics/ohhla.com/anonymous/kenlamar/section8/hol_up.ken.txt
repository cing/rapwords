Artist: Kendrick Lamar
Album:  #Section80
Song:   Hol' Up
Typed by: newos_crib_is@hotmail.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all these passengers
they'll probably think I'm a terrorist
Eat my asparagus, then I'm asking her
Thoughts of a young nigga, fast money and freedom
A crash dummy for diamonds, I know you dying to meet 'em
I'll probably die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million and a Comp-town fitted

[Chorus]
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Yeah, big shit popping, Section 80

[Kendrick Lamar]
Back in this bitch in the back of that bitch
with my back against the wall, and your bitch on the edge of my dick
Jump off, I call a bitch a bitch
A hoe a hoe, a woman a woman, I never did nothing
but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddling
with the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
I lived my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told I'm like '87
Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From a distance, don't know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012? There's no one, not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help, somebody

[Chorus]
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Yeah, big shit popping, everybody watching
When you do it like this nigga, losing ain't an option
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Yeah, big shit popping
Ay, ay, kick her out the studio Ali

[Kendrick Lamar]
Twenty-four seven nigga, working his ass for it, she popping that ass for it
The King of Diamonds with diamonds I never do ask for
They checking my passport, I'm too accustomed with customs
She call in the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff him
They want me fast-forward the game, and why you complain
when you niggas is past poor? You'll never hop in my lane
When you pushing a RAV4, you wrecking my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard

[Chorus]
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Yeah, big shit popping, everybody watching
When you do it like this nigga, losing ain't an option
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
Yeah, big shit popping, everybody watching
When you do it like this nigga

[Kendrick Lamar]
I wrote this record while thirty-thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all these passengers
they'll probably think I'm Osama
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor, hol' up!</pre>
