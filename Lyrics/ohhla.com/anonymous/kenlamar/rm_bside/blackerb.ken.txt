Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Assassin
Album:  The Blacker the Berry {S}
Song:   The Blacker the Berry
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro]
Everything black, I don't want black
I don't like e'rything black, ain't need black
Some white, some black, I ain't want black
I hate e'rything black, black
Ohh now we black, I don't need black
I don't like e'rything black, I don't need black
I'll die we black, I ain't on black
I want everything black

[Kendrick Lamar - singing]
Six in the morn', fire in the street
Burn baby burn, that's all I wan' see
And sometimes I get off watchin you die in vain
It's such a shame, they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin
But homie you made me
Black don't crack, my nigga
(My nigga, my nigga, my nigga, my nigga)
(My nigga, my nigga, my nigga, my nigga)

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American
I'm African, I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you? You hate my people
Your plan is to terminate my culture, you're fuckin evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin my feelings - I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community makin a killin
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Interlude]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Chorus: Assassin]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip? Left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All dem a say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the Black
Just remember that

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizin that I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalize, manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me, don't you? I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout
Ah, black and successful, this black man meant to be special
CAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm makin a killin?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listen then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American
I'm African, I'm black as the heart of a fuckin Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you, no fuck y'all! That's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you? You hate my people
I can tell cause it's threats when I see you, I can tell cause your way's deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-day
Or eat watermelon, chicken and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
when gang bangin make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!</pre>
