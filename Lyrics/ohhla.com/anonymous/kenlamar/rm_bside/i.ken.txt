[Intro]
"We got a young brother that STANDS for something!
 We got a young brother that believes in all of us!
 Brother Kendrick Lamar! He's not a rapper, he's a writer!
 He's an author! And if you read between the lines,
 we'll learn how to love one another! But you can't do that!
 I said you can't do that without loving yourself fir-"

(This is a wooooorld premier! This is a wooooorld premier!)

[Kendrick Lamar]
I done been through a whole lot
Trials, tribulations but I know God
Satan wanna put me in a bowtie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yea-yay!
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But ain't no nigga gon' never drown me
In front of a dirty double mirror they found me and...

[Chorus]
I love myself!
(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs)
I love myself!
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself!
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love my...self!
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody lookin at you crazy (crazy!)
What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)
..Lift up yo' head and keep movin
or let the paranoia haunt you
Peace to fashion, police, I wear my heart
on my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times our potential was anonymous?
How many times the city makin me promises?
So I promise this

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
They wanna say it's a war outside and a bomb in the street
And a gun in the hood and a mob of police
In Iraq, on the corner, in a line full of fiends
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme
Yep... these days are frustration, keep y'all on tuck and rotation
I duck these cold faces, post up fe-fi-fo-fum basis
Dreams are reality's peace (Ho-hey!)
Blow steam in the face of the beast
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now
The stronger me'll still smile

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Walk - my - bare - feet (Walk - my - bare - feet)
Down - down - valley - deep (Down - down - valley - deep) {I love myself!}
Fe - fi - fo - fum (Fe - fi - fo - fum) {I love myself!}
My - heart - un - done (My - heart - un - done)

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I went to war last night...
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it 'til I get it right
I went to war last night...
I've been dealin with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin every other blessings, I can never see the message
I can never take the lead, I can never bob and weave
For my nigga they be lettin 'em annihilate me
And the sounds that I'm movin in at meteor speed
Finna run into a building, let my body in the streets
Keep my money in the ceiling, let my momma know I'm free
Give my story to the children and a lesson they can read
And a glory to the feeling of the audience scenes
Send 'em up, make a motherfucker scream - I LOVE MYSELF~!

[Outro]
I lost my head, I must misread what the Good Book said
Oh woes be me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry, i...</pre>
