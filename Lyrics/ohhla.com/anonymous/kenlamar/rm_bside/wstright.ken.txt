[Kendrick Lamar]
Canei Finch on the beat
Turn the headphones up, Ali
Here we go

I woke up this morning with my dick on hard
Didn't know why till I said fuck all y'all
or fuck this world, or I'ma fuck that girl
'good kid, m.A.A.d. city', watch my day unfurl
I put my life in these sentences, fucking right
It's either that or life sentences, I'm relatives with Benjamin
I used to give a fuck about my luck when I was innocent
Now what the fuck is up? I'm at your neck like a Pendleton
Nigga, I need that, bitch, I need that
Twenty-four acres and a mule, best believe that
They say he got smoked, like where the weed at
And everything you hope, bitch nigga, we that
Pockets on Kelly Price, back when it was '95
Buy a strap and then we cock it back when it's uncircumcised
Write a rap on how we just react when shotty hit the spine
Give you dap, and then we slide through your hood three-dozen times
So what's good? I'm looking for a pedicure, pink
pussy that pop, preferably the kind that don't stink
Uhh, bomb ass head, uhh, till she can't blink
and her eyes get watery, you gotta pardon me

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm so damn turnt, wheeling in a two-door
with two hoes that follow me, and you know
Westside, right on time, tell them hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto though, but
Westside, right on time, only thing for sure, uhh
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door, uhh

[Young Jeezy]
I woke up this morning like fuck the world
Been hustling since I was twelve, man I've been through hell
Now these motherfuckers is tryna tell me I don't care
Tryna tell y'all motherfuckers, look, y'all wasn't there
Third posted up on the block, waiting for mail
This for my niggas posted up in the county praying for bail
Could have cost your boy everything, man it wasn't cheap
Coming for a nigga, just don't sleep, shit for the weak
Got on my Malcolm X frames, now I count my checks mayne
cause every time I speak, you hear my Malcolm X pain
Now them doors go up on that Lamb', they like judo
Don't you like your bitches with an ass? I like you hoe
First them bitches see me, I'm gone, I'm like Pluto
Plus I keep them choppers that sing, they Mars Bruno
Brown bag full of cash baby, MCM
When they ask me my name, I tell 'em MC him, straight up

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
All praise go to the most high, uhh
All fades turn into a drive-by
Part ways from the streets after fucking with police, guaranteed
Last nigga did that died, don't you, don't you, don't you
wanna live where the AK go for only 8K
minus six racks, minus one on top of that? Melee
Stomp him out, then drug him out like a date rape
Daytonas bending every corner while they say

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
All I ever wanted was a dollar bill and hundreds
and my teacher as my woman, when she smiled I stick my tongue in
Plus some cartoons and some cereal, Snoop Doggy on my stereo
Some British Knights or L.A. Gears with glowing lights, or Perry Ellis jacket
I would love a swap meet full of Chevrolets in candy paint
that's wet with Tammy on the bumper, can I hump her? Poppa tell me yes
A D.P.G.C. concert and a DJ Quik song on cassette
Twenty years later, hi hater, I'm the fucking best

[Chorus]</pre>
