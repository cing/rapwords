Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ James Fauntleroy, Ronald Isley
Album:  To Pimp a Butterfly
Song:   How Much a Dollar Cost?
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Kendrick Lamar]
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I'm chillin once I park this luxury car
Hoppin out feeling big as Mutombo, twenty on pump six dirty
Marcellus called me Dumbo twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend 'em a ear or two, how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept that what men'll do
Twenty-oh-six, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu, my American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station, a homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten rand, stressin about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin
He begged and pleaded, asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, "Beat it" contributin money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you - nothin less, nothin more"
I told him I ain't have it then closed my door, tell me how much a dollar cost

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
All you neeeeed... is more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need the air you breathe

[Kendrick Lamar]
He's starin at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin, he's starin at me, I grab my key
He's starin at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin told me to keep it in park until I can see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin ME for a favor
He's starin at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
Cause now I'm starin back at him, feelin some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin at his neck
I never understood someone beggin for goods
Askin for handouts, takin it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin at me for the longest until he finally asked
"Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
 'A humble man is all that we ever need', tell me how much a dollar cost"

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Guilt trippin and feelin resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin
Sour emotions got me lookin at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies
I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin all the time
I got better judgment, I know when niggaz hustlin
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin, I did compromise
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine
reekin from your skin, moonshine and gin
Nigga you're babblin, your words ain't flatterin, I'm imaginin
Denzel but lookin at O'Neal, +Kazaam+ your sad thrills
Your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up
I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free
 You're lookin at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
 The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve
 Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
 The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God"

[Outro: Ronald Isley]
I wash my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone (oh yeah...)
Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs</pre>
