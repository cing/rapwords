(AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!)
...(AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!)
...(AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!)

[Chorus]
Lovin you is complicate-AHHED!!!
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicate-AHHED!!
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicate-AHHED!
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated

[Kendrick Lamar]
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
confidence in yourself, breakin on marble floors
Watchin anonymous strangers tellin me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit I'm convinced your tolerance nothin special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
situation had stopped with your little sister bakin
A baby inside, just a teenager, where's your patience?
Where's your antennas, where is the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin tell you, you fuckin failure, YOU AIN'T NO LEADER!
I never liked you, forever despise you, I DON'T NEED YOU!
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
I fuckin hate you, I hope you embrace it, I swear...

[Chorus]
Lovin you is complicate-AHHED!!!
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicate-AHHED!!
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicate-AHHED!
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you is complicated
Lovin you, lovin you, not lovin you, one hundred proof!

("I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me...
 Yes, I hate you too")

{*music stops then slows down, Spanish hotel worker knocks on door*}

"Lovin you is complicated, what I got to to do to get to you? To get to you?"

[Kendrick Lamar - in drunk, cracky voice]
Are you the reason why momma and 'nem leavin?
No you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was yo' presence, where was yo' support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend
Lil' brother, you promised you'd watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven
You even Facetimed instead of a hospital visit
You should thought he would recover well...
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding, for real
Then he died, God himself will say "You fuckin failed! You ain't try!"

{*sniffling*}

I know yo' secrets nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
I know depression is restin on yo' heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin, nigga
Y'all damn near beefin, I seen it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk {*deep swig*}
I cry myself to sleep, bitch everything is your fault
Faults breakin to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know yo' secrets, don't let me tell them to the world
about that shit you thinkin, and that time you- {*swig*} I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think yo' heart made of bulletproof
Shoulda killed yo' ass a long time ago
You shoulda felt that black Revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk, it would say "You GOTTA go!!"
And if I told your secrets, the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness</pre>
