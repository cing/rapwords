[Intro]
Oh SHIT~! I need that, I need dat sloppy, that sloppy (Yo...)
Like a Chevy in quicksand... Yeah, that sloppy

("So it seeeeeeeeems...")

[Kendrick Lamar]
This feeling is unmatched
This feeling is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap (West, West, West...)
We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, West, West...)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimickin radio's nemesis may be wack
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
the mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin scratchin dilligent sentences backwards
Visitin freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin Benjamin benefits, sinnin in traffic
Spinnin women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin in, every decision, Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isn't it, lovely how menaces turned attraction?
Pivotin rappers, finish your fraction while writin blue magic
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that? The fact it brought me back home

[Chorus]
We been waitin for you, Waitin for you
Waitin for you, waitin for... you

[Kendrick Lamar]
I know everything... I know everything, know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you, I know everything
I know Compton, I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious
I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history, I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well that's God's decision
I know you know that lines from Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip about how it was distributed
I know how... people work
I know the price of life, I'm knowin how much it’s worth
I know what I know and I know it well not to ever forget
Until I realized I didn’t know shit, the day I came home

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand-me-down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin on his beady beads exhausted
Tossin footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin new laws momma passed on home trainin
He looked at me and said, "Kendrick you do know my language
 You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
 Oh I forgot, +Don't Kill My Vibe+, that's right, you're famous
 I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
 But never mind, you're here right now don't you mistake it
 It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
 Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress
 And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil
 You spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
 I can attempt, to enlighten you without frightenin you
 If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
 But if you pick, destiny over rest in peace
 Then be an advocate, tell your homies especially to come back home"

{*beat stops then changes*}

This is a Woooooorld Premier (This is a World Premier...)
This is a Woooooorld Premier (This is a World Premier...)
(This is a World Premier...)

[Kendrick Lamar]
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me somethin, got me losin my mind - AHH~!!
You make me wanna jump (JUMP, JUMP. JUMP, JUMP)
{Let's talk about love...} (JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP)
{Let's talk about love...} (JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP) AHH!!
{Let's talk about love...} (JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP) AHH!! AHH-AHH!!
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me somethin, think I'm losin my mind, ha!
I say where you at, from the front to the back
I'm lookin for you I react, only when you react
Ha, I thought I found you, back in the ghet-to
When I was seventeen with the .38 spec-ial
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel {*song starts to fade*}
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me I'm suicidal anyway, I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is...</pre>
