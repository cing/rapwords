Artist: Kendrick Lamar
Album:  To Pimp a Butterfly
Song:   You Ain't Gotta Lie (Momma Said)
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro]
Study long, study wrong, nigga
Hey, y'all close that front door, y'all let flies in this muh'fucker!
Close that door! My OG up in this muh'erfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle in his hand, ackin a fool
Hey, hey, babe check it out, I'ma tell you what my mama had said, she like..

[Kendrick Lamar]
I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name

[Bridge]
Askin where the hoes at to impress me
Askin where the moneybags to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin where the plug at to impress me
Askin where the jug at to impress me
Askin where it's at only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard

[Kendrick Lamar]
...And the world don't respect you
and the culture don't accept you but you think it's all love
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one
Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex)
Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex)
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context

[Chorus + Bridge]

[Kendrick Lamar]
...What do you got to offer?
Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin, been a virgin to bullshit
And sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggaz be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
This is for fugazi, niggaz and bitches
who make habitual lyin babies, bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me, you can never relate me
to him (him), to her (her), or that (that) or them (them)
Or you (you), the truth (truth) you love (love) to bend (bend)
In the back (back), in the bed (bed), on the floor, that's yo' ho
On the couch (couch), in her mouth (mouth), I'll be out, really doe
See loud, rich niggaz got low money
And loud, broke niggaz got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel

[Chorus]</pre>
