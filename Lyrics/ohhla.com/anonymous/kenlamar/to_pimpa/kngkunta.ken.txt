Artist: Kendrick Lamar f/ Anna Wise
Album:  To Pimp a Butterfly
Song:   King Kunta
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a bone to pick...
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again!
(Ay, ay nigga, what's happenin' nigga? K-Dot back in the hood, nigga)
I'm mad {he mad!} but I ain't stressin'
... True friends, one question

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (Anna Wise)
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta - everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta - black man takin' no losses {aw yeah!}
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta - everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams (what's the yams?)

[Kendrick Lamar] + (Anna Wise)
... The yam is the power that be {*echoes*}
... You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can!) I can dig rappin'
... But a rapper with a ghostwriter, what the fuck happened?
(Oh no!) ... I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of y'all share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (a two-man cell)
Somethin's in the water {somethin's in the water}
And if I got a brown nose for some gold then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
... The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor {*echoes*}
... Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
... 24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemies and say

[Chorus] - minus last bar line

{"You goat-mouthed mammyfucker!"}

[Kendrick Lamar]
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they don't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton"
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done to be honest
And I put that on my mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo~!
Ah yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five and there I was
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king

Bitch where was you when I was- {*gunshot*}
{"By the time you hear the next pop, the funk shall be within you"}
{*gunshot*} Now I run the game got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta - everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta - black man takin' no losses (aw yeah!)
Bitch where was you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta - everybody wanna cut the legs off him...

[Outro: Anna Wise]
{"Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk"}
We want the funk! We want the funk!
{"Now if I give you the funk, you gon', take it?"}
We want the funk!
{"Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?"}
We want the funk!
{"Now if I give you the funk, you gon', take it?"}
We want the funk! {"Do you want the funk?"}
We want the funk! {"Do you want the funk?"}
We want the funk!
{"Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?"}
We want the funk!

[Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted, misusin' your influence</pre>
