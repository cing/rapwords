Artist: Kendrick Lamar
Album:  To Pimp a Butterfly
Song:   Hood Politics
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Intro]
"K-Dot, pick up the phone, nigga
 Every time I call, it's goin to voice mail...
 Don't TELL me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga!
 No socks and skinny jeans and shit, hah!
 Hahahahahahahahahaha! ...Call me on Shaniqua's phone"

(Woo-WOO-WOO-WOO-WOO...)

[Chorus]
I been A1 since day one, you niggaz boo-boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from - boo-boo
Lil' hoes you went to school with - boo-boo
Baby mama and your new bitch - boo-boo!
We was in the hood, fourteen with the deuce-deuce
Fourteen years later goin hard, like we used to
on the dead homies... on the dead homies....

[Kendrick Lamar]
I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
My lil' homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
FUCK what they talkin 'bout, yo' shit is where it's at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck yo' fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game, yo' hood, yo' name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin to the scripts, now hip, them Benjamins gon' cuddle up
Skip - hop - drip - drop
Flip - flop with the white tube sock
It goes ("Sherrrrm Sticks, burrrrrrn this")
That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute, out the Compton Zoo, with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they FUCK with you
Asians, they FUCK with you, nobody can't FUCK with you

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called, they said, "The enemies done cliqued up"
Oh YEAH? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh YEAH? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh YEAH? Everything is everything, it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin, scramblin, football numbers slanderin
Niggaz name on paper, you snitched all summer
Streets don't fail me now...
They tell me it's a new gang in town....
From Compton - to Congress, set trippin all around
Ain't nothin' new but a flow of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs, make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it Do?"
(OBAMA SAY WHAT IT DO... OBAMA SAY WHAT IT DO)

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody wanna talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white and who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin
Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y'all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don't ask about no camera blockin at award shows
No don't ask about my bitch, no don't ask about my foes
'Less you askin me about power, yeah I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby â€œK. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up
 Pandora's box, I box 'em all in, by a landslide"
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sittin down with Jay
He said "It's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"

[Outro]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggaz boo-boo

{"I remembered you was conflicted, misusing your influence
  Sometimes I did the same, abusing my power full of resentment
  Resentment that turned into a deep depression
  Found myself screamin in the hotel room
  I didn't wanna self-destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me
  ...So I went runnin for answers, until I came home
  But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
  Going back and forth, trying to convince my self the stripes I earned
  Or maybe how A1 my foundation was
  But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war back in the city
  I was entering a new one"}</pre>
