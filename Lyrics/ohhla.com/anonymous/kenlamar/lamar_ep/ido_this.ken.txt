Song:   I Do This

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I used to to wanna by like Michael Jordan
Figured that I'd hit the NBA and make a fortune
Thank God for these rap recordings
I can ball like him on every verse and chorus
5-0-1s, Louis letterman jacket
Little brother only five, momma put him on my taxes
You know that Compton ghetto shit
that every Section 8 tenant is familiar with? Ooh wee
They say he something like the seventies, but I'm from '87
With a thousand dimes, you got eighty sevens
Gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
Fucking all my high school teachers, that was '05 bro
And I don't like 'em if the ass thin
And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
The fuck I look like?
A billion bucks, and that's why

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this

[Kendrick Lamar]
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it, hoe
Uh, so give me fifty feet champ
Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp
I'm in the hot spot, I know they seats damp
And I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp
You Nix Check Cashing
I'm GT crashing, 1-0-5 off ramp
Ay, that lil' nigga got it going on
G5, going-going-going gone
Cloud nine mind state
I drop a record, then I raise the crime rate
Killing this shit, where's your funeral tie?
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck, skip to Y

[Chorus 2]

[Jay Rock]
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
Say she on birth control, no I don't trust it
Aooow~! First off, I'm a rider bitch
Put them twenty-sixes on a Silverado bitch
I keep my bitch with a finer bitch
Snap my fingers, she'll go and find a bitch
Tell them fuck boys that I do this
Got the best product round town, Frank Lucas
Confuse 'em like a Rubix cube when I roll up
Okay, Subway bread like some cold cuts
And I drop cold cuts, bitches go crazy
Wild like a Haitian, I should set up shop in Haiti
Fuck you, pay me, paper over pussy nigga
When I drop, you ain't getting paper nor pussy nigga

[Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this</pre>
