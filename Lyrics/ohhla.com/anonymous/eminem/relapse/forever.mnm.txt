[Hook: Drake]
It may not mean nothin to y'all
But understand nothin was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin at all
I want this shit forever mayne, (ever mayne, ever mayne)
I'm shuttin shit down in the mall
And tellin every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin to call
I want this shit forever mayne, (ever mayne, ever mayne)
 
[Drake]
Last name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy, I ain't nothin to play wit
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G-4 pilots on a first name basis
Any city faded off the brown, +Nino+
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin in the money, come and find me, +Nemo+
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'd a thought a country wide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside a X like +Malcolm+
Everybody gotta deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga I'm about my business
Killin all these rappers, you would swear I had a hitlist
Everyone who doubted me is askin for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches

And tellin every girl she the one for me

[Kanye West]
I used to have hood dreams, big fame. big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain, offspring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
Y'all had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gon build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button (what?) nothin man
Now super bad chicks givin me +McLovin+
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin wasn't
Um, your'e such a fuckin loser
He ain't even go to class, +Bueller+
Trade the grammy plaques, just to have my granny back
'member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasin the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out, and God damn he snap
I used to want this thing forever, you can have it back
 
[Hook: Drake]
It may not mean nothin to y'all

[Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello its the martian, Space Jam jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chaffuer "to the top"
Life is such a fuckin roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for? this is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin in the lead, I need a pillow and a tucker
My foots sleepin on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh
 
[Hook: Drake]
It may not mean nothin to y'all
But understand nothin was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin at all
I want this shit forever mayne, (ever mayne, ever mayne)

And tellin every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin to call
I want this shit forever mayne, (ever mayne, ever mayne)
 
[Eminem]
There they go
Packin stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go
Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozo's
He's wonderin if he should spit this slow
FUCK NO, go for broke
This cup just runneth over, almost
He ain't had a reproach like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin patiently for Pinnochio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they kno
Rap will never be same as before
Bashin in the brains of these hoes
And establishin the name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That im talkin about when we riot
You dealin wit a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth spillin
And spit true feelins until our truth feelins
Come flyin up outta our mouth, now rewind it
Pay back motherfucker for the way that you got at me, how's it taste? 
When I slap the taste outta ya mouth
Wit the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lector so just in case you're thinkin of saving face
You ain't gon have no face to save by the time I'm thru with this place, so Drake
