Artist: Eminem
Album:  Relapse: Refill
Song:   Taking My Ball
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro: Eminem]
Yo, Dre man
Make my, vocals sound, sexy
Woo! C'mon man, c'mon man, OKAY!

[Chorus: Eminem]
It feels so wrong cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to, play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, hoooome

[Eminem]
I'm that guy man, shove a diamond up my hind end
And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals
Slut, poke holes in your shirt, jump in mud puddles
while I stomp mudholes in ya ass girl now let's cuddle
Blood curdling, you're gurgling on your blood, what'll
I do for my next trick? I'm feeling won-derful
I think I might just do somethin a little less subtle
Shove a fuckin Tonka truck up a little kid's butthole
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador 
of the Valentine's Day Massacre
Slash assassin, I'll slash her in the ass with a 
icicle and leave her lay in a bloodbath while I 
put a catheter in, and jump in the bath with her
In my Spider-Man mask, man just imagine the
fun I can have with a strap-on
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon
Are those pistachios? Damn, I'd like to have some
Layin on the patio man, rolling a fat one
"Shady drop the magic marker, put the cap on
Goddamn man, are you that much of an asshole?"

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
I'm like Houdini, tuck my teenie-eenie weenie between each
one of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie
Make the shit disappear like Tara Reid in a bikini
Believe me homie you don't know the meaning of a meanie
They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter
I'm tryin to maneuver the Hoover up in your poop shoot, don't move or ya
might get it stuck so fuckin far up in your uvula
You ain't gonna know what he was tryin to do to ya gluteus
Totally tubular sniffing glue through a tube in the studia
Now who do ya think is more fruitier?
Wiener smothered in peanut butter - putting on a tube of ya 
eye shadow and man it look nice, you shoulda seen it Mother
I think I'll put a piece of art on my Visa card
Then I'll go beat Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosey on over to Rosie O'Donnell's, with McDonald's
Jump in her lap then watch "The Sopranos"

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
"Shady what are ya doin chewin on a human?"
Grab an aluminum bat, hit Heidi Klum in the back, BOOM and
assumin the fact that that dude's in the back room
Usin the bathroom, vacuumin a raccoon
Skewin a rat, a cat screwin a baboon
You shouldn't ask what is he doing with that broom
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds
You in a trance? I'm back doing my dance, ooh!
But they're afraid I might get Sarah Palin 
by the hair and make her wear a bathing suit and take her parasailing
"Shady, why do you gotta pick on the lady for?
Why you make her read 84 bedtime stories to you in baby talk?"
Cause I'm scared, there's monsters under my bed
Kellie Pickler hid my juicebox under my bassinet
No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed
You like graffiti dyke? Well I can pee-pee and write your name

[Chorus]

[Outro: Eminem]
Fine, nobody wants to play with me?
Fuck you then, bitch!
Guys are always mean to me anyways
All you ever do is rub gum in my hair and stuff
You guys are gonna make me, make me sad
I'm sad, I'm gonna cry, I'm cryin {*sobs*}
I'm gonna tell my mom, MOMMMMM?!</pre>
