[Intro: Eminem]
All aboard! Okay
Next stop, my basement, ha ha
I'll meet you down there!

[Chorus: Eminem]
There once was a saying that, I used to say
back in the day when, I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
that if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said "What if you went platinum?" I'll just laugh at him
"That's, not happenin, that I can't fathom"
80-some million records worldwide later
I'm living, in a house with a fuckin elevator

[Eminem]
Haters gettin mad, they done had enough of Shady
You slay me, nothin you say matters enough to touché me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Whoops-a-that-a fuckin daisy
That's a no-no, even she knows Dada's fuckin crazy
Fuckin animal, cuckoo, bananas, fuckin ape-y
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby {*wahhh*}
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep up on ya but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn you when you started
Now your brain's all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I oughta just be honest but

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get, so mad when I call 'em both fa-ggots
All these fuckin voices in my head, I can't take it
{*wahhh*} Someone shut that fuckin baby up 'fore I shake it!
You're standin adjacent to Jason slash Leatherface and
together makes 'em, a fuckin bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the weinerschnitzel up his ass, hopped away some-
-body please stop the patient, get the cops to mace him
Homie I'm the schizer! Ask Dr. Dre son
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No, not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I'll leave for one brief second
And you pussies queef all over the rap game nekkid
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stains, feck it
I'll just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Elevator in my house, ha! I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in the microwave I'm
thinkin 'bout an escalator now, steps I hate 'em
Told the neighbors step away then I just pepper sprayed him
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hide out, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down fucker, baa, try countin sheep!
And you're tryin to find out why now there's beef
Mace in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth!
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the stop
Stand above 'em just to cut the fuckin cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yellin stop

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Fuckin son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fuckin A, I even got a bidet to
wash my ass after I shit, with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher so big when I'm pissed off I can just toss a
flying saucer in it, the shit's awesome
Yeah, fuckin elevator
Livin in a house with a fuckin elevator

{*vocal scratches*}
Elevator {*chka-chk-err-chka-chk*} elevator</pre>
