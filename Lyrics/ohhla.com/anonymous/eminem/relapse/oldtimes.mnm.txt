Artist: Eminem f/ Dr. Dre
Album:  Relapse
Song:   Old Time's Sake
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro: Eminem]
Good evening, this is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of, 4 million-and-a-half feet
That's 8 million miles in the sky
Please, undo your seatbelt for takeoff {*kchht*}
You are now free to smoke about the cabin, cabin, chka

[Dr. Dre]
I'm Dre from, back in the day from
N.W.A. from, black and the gray from
Chokin a bitch to, smackin her face from
Stackin up bodies to, rackin AK's up
From rackin up hits to, stackin them crates up
I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happenin in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, far as competition faggot there ain't none

[Eminem]
Speak of the devil it's attack of the Rainman
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun, vrunn, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon, no one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny man it's urgent, I need one
Two boxes of detergent and a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1, so

[Chorus: Eminem]
One more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat, and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go - you are now smokin with the best, best, chka
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat, and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's gooo - you are now smokin with the best, best, chka

[Eminem]
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless
A nice environment, surprised entirely
Hypotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants
Takin lives of firemen
Say goodbye, here I am again; naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high pussy bwoy I could spin
Vinn, vinn; fuck the handle I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench coach and throw it to him
There he goes in his trenchcoat, no clothes again
Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my fore-a-skin
Show me nipple, I'm pinch both and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse, if it's forced it's him
Don't fight the feelin if you're feelin the force within
Then when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain, so

[Chorus]

[Dr. Dre]
Now where there's smoke there's fire, where there's fire there's flames
Where there's flames there's chronic, either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

[Eminem]
Nuh-uh, he ain't playin
He's gon' get the AK and aim it right at your brai-ain
I'm slightly insa-ane, vodka and Creatine
Hypnotiq and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's "giving me wings," +I Believe I Can Fly+
While I pee on the girl, you won't catch me C.S.I.
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake

[Dr. Dre]
Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you're smokin with the tried-est and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rollin shit up
You motherfuckers ain't smokin, you just holdin shit up
Now here we go let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
Cause if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seein as how, I blew up off of puffin them trees

[Eminem] + (Dr. Dre)
Well smoke enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up Cheech
C'mon, smoke me out cuz, give me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
"But this is Earth calling, Shady man, come on back!" What?
"Man we're losin him, he won't even respond back, fuck!"
Now look at all the pretty women in here (damn bitches)
Dre it's hot, I think we better go check on their temperatures
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
Now baby just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit just
And give me

[Chorus]</pre>
