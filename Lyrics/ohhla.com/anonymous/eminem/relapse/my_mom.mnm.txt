Artist: Eminem
Album:  Relapse
Song:   My Mom
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Okay, aight aight aight aight aight aight
Yo, yo.. yo, yo!
Aight I'ma lay the chorus first
Here we go now!

[Chorus: Eminem]
My mom, loved Valium, and lots of drugs
That's why I am, like I am, cause I'm like her
Because my mom, loved Valium, and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on, what I'm on, cause I'm my mom

[Eminem]
My mom, my mom! I know you're probably tired 
of hearin 'bout my mom – oh-ho, whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
and how I became hooked on Va-aliu-ums
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin peas on my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day I'd have at least three stomachaches
Now tell me, what kinda mother would wanna see her
son grow up to be an under-a-fuckin-chiever
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin either
"What the fuck you stickin gum up under the fuckin seat for?
Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffin ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin reefer"
But all this huffin and puffin wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzin but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a teacup? Bitch you ain't my keeper
I'm sleepin, what the fuck you keep on fuckin with me for?
Slut you need to leave me the - fuck alone
I ain't playin, go find you a white crayon and color a fuckin zebra

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
"You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers, now just wait 'til
I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
Ya little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make that 
retarded fuckin face without even tastin it
You better lick the fuckin plate, you ain't wastin it
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin in - you're gonna just sit there
in one fuckin place finnickin 'til next Thanksgiving and
if you still ain't finished it I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business kid!"
My mom - there's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on
Cause

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
My mom loved Valium, now all I am
is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach
But my bars only last about two minutes
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin it
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
My Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohhhhhhh

Man I never thought that I could ever be
a drug addict, naw, fuck that I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually, what has ended up happenin
A tregedy; the fuckin past ended up catchin me
And it's, probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb ma, beautiful!
She killed the fuckin dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin aspirin and say that it has a headache
"Here, want a snack? You hungry you fuckin brat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap
Eat it!" But I don't need it! "Well fuck it then break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up!"
Aight Ma you win, I don't feel like arguin
I'll do it, pop it, gobble it and start wobblin
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip then I fall in bed
with a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead

[Chorus]

[Outro: Eminem]
My mom, I'm just like her
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my momma
Me momma, ay like-a da momma
Haha, sorry mom
I still love you though {*smooch*}
Dr. Dre 2010, ay this shit is hella hard homie
Yo take us on outta here, woo!</pre>
