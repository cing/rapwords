Artist: Eminem
Album:  Relapse
Song:   Same Song & Dance
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro: Eminem]
Yo (same song and dance)
Damn girl (everywhere I go, same song and dance)
I like the way you move (all over the globe, same song and dance)
Something about it man (same song and dance)
In the pale moonlight (yo)

[Eminem]
I'm lookin at ya, yeah girl, you're kinda tooken back by
the whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
Probably thinkin you'll get slapped so dang hard ya
won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Couple rape charges people think you're a monster
The police constantly buggin you non-stop
I walk up on ya, well hello Tonya
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You out of gas? Do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundry mat, I got your back
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
and sit up front, I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a wrap
In broad day, and no masks for this attack
I heard 'em say, exact opposites attract
If that's a fact, it'll take taskforce to get you back, c'mon

[Chorus: Eminem]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got
Give it your all, look at you bawl, why you cryin to me?
Same song and dance

[Eminem]
The first victim I had she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every 4 to 6 months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
At Nickelodeon flashed the little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in son
Look here she comes, I'd better pull out the big guns
Hello Lindsay, you're lookin a little thin hon
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in cunt!
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl I'm just kidding, let me start over again hon
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wencher, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you it would've already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to
lynch her with 66 inches of extension, cord

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played the little schoolgirl when she first
burst up on the scene, it seemed that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me, it made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs, 
but what was really goin on was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons or
footage of me impalin myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos and just
Climb the gate and ring the bell like, "Hello my love"
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you cause I'm feelin you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since the schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feelin you, ooh ooh girl you sexy little gal you
Hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to, make a new outfit outta you
New outfit? Shit I'll make a suit outta you, shoot
Now show me how you move, baby do how-a you do

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Same kickin and screamin, same cryin and sobbin
Same song and dance
Same beggin and pleadin, same yellin and bleedin
Same song and dance
Yeah, same song and dance
I know, same song and dance</pre>
