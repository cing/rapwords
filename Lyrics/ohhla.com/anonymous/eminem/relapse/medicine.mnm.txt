Album:  Relapse
Song:   Medicine Ball

[Intro: Eminem]
Ohh, my goodness! What have I done?
Oh no (oh no) I can't believe it! (believe it)
It's like (it's like)
I've got the whole WORLD, in my palm (in my palm)
And I'm ready to drop bombs

[Eminem]
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector!
I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bi-sexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter in the guy section I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya
They say once bitten and twice shy, well lie next to
the guy with nine extasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ripped condoms in quantities, why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try Lester?
Dropkick the bitch before her second trimester
Perform the home abortion with Dexter then I guess I'll
dig her fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her

[Chorus: Eminem]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends

[Eminem]
All my Westside bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the deep end, sho' enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwin up
Man you seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl, don't front, oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole you kiddin?
I'll pee on Rihanna, see man I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy gluing Madonna
to the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two then sit on her
Imagine a visual for that man, who woulda thought I
could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeace
But the chick's so old she looks like she out-lived a life sentence
I never meant this, rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive!

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here, you need a hand, big man? Grab hold of this branch
with both hands, man they don't understand I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me - like it's my fault
his name rhymes with so many different words, jeez!
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please
"Eminem, I'm coming to kill you {*sniffs*}
 Always hated you and I still do
 You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume {*sniffs*}
 doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
 You're taking this shit too far {*sniffs*}
 Who do you think you are? Hang my suit up in the armoire
 Every day I hate you more and more, throw down the cardboard
 Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore"

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
The world is mine! (the world is mine)</pre>
