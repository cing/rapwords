Artist: Eminem f/ D-12
Album:  The Eminem Show
Song:   When the Music Stops
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash {with help from liner notes}

[Bizarre]
Music.. reality..
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers.. have a responsibility
to these kids.. psyche!

[Eminem]
If I, were to die murdered in cold blood tommorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love, or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
if there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate, I done came way
too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for a joke? You smokin crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground
'Fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryin to smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
Y'all steady tryin to drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothin but piss me off, lid to the can of whip-ass
Just twist me off, see me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shootin I'm just tryin to knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap, motherfucker if you really feelin froggish leap
Yo Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
Man I hate this crap
This ain't rap, this is crazy the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops

[Swifty McVay]
Ain't no gettin rid of McVay, if so you woulda tried
The only way I'm leavin this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemies' crib
with Hennessey, got drunk then I finished it {*BLAM*}
I'm every nigga's favorite arch enemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a dillinger in the dark dilligently
I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight
to awake neighbors for acres
I'll murder you, I gauge and have me turn into a mad man
Son of sam bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dyin, you think not?
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops

[Kon Artis]
I was happy havin a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy but it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dog
And you ain't got nuttin left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin with their hands out, checkin for your record when it's sellin
When it ain't that's the end, no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink, till your car spin you think
DAMN! When you slam into the wall
and you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow wonder would they even call?
When the music stops

[Kuniva]
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up lookin for you with a pistol, sippin a can of penzoil
I'm revved up, who said what, when lead bust
your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed
Tossed in the paddywagon; braggin about how you shouted
like a coward, bullets devoured you, showered you niggaz
If I was you niggaz, I'd run while given a chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself it can hurt me
Just the thought of dyin alone that really irks me
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop tryin to walk how G's walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playin tug-of-war with your life
Fuck a tour and a mike, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife {AHH!}
Deliver that shit that coroner's like
You hype poppin shit in broad daylight
Nigga you're a goner at night - when the music stops

[Proof]
Instigators, turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors, wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like WOOF!
Proof nigga I'ma wolf, get your whole roof
caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breathe shit the more I moves
It's _Hill Street_, this is hardcore _Blues_
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues (nigga)
Or make the news, betcha all y'all move
When the uzi pop you better drop, when the music stop

[Bizarre]
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to "Rock the Bells"
NWA said "Fuck the Police," now I'm in jail
Ninety-three was strictly R&B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson - who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin Priscilla tonight
Flyin down Sunset smokin crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P. had me grimey and gritty
Marilyn Manson I dyed my hair blue, and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm goin in shock
I'm reachin for the glock but the music stops {*blam*}</pre>
