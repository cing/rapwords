{"You don't own me, don't try to change me"}

[Eminem]
Nah man, I'm not quite finished yet
Ha ha, woo!

Girl I think you just mighta tried to pull a muh'fuckin fast one, I'm mad
You just hurt my goddamn feelin and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade? Tryin to play games? See this saw blade?
See this silhouette, of a stalker, in your walkway? Better co-operate
or get sautéed, and rotisseried, while you're hog-tied
MC's get so quiet you can hear a muh'fuckin dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin on that ass like the fuckin +Fall Guy+
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
Cause it will turn into a +Gremlin+ and run over kids, women and men
Vrinn-vrinn, motor so big you fit a midgit in his engine
Bitch give me them digits, why you cringin? Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
will I spend-spend even ten cents on you, since when 
do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny? Shit, if I think a penny's pretty
Just imagine how, beautiful a quarter is to me
Eeny-meeny-miney-mo, catch an Eskimo by his toe while he's tryin to roll a snowball
But don't make him lose his cool, if he hollers better let him go y'all!
Cause

[Chorus]
{"You don't own me"}
Now here we go, go, GOOOOO!

[Eminem]
Get up baby, get a move on like a U-Haul, you can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shit, yeah honey you called?
Well here I come, Havoc on the beat I wreak it; evil I see, hear and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket, you can count every muh'fuckin chicken 'fore it hatches
Cause you can bet your ass that, we gon' get it crackin
Like the Kraken in +Titans+ when they +Clashin+, get your brains bashed in
so bad you gon' have Kurt Cobain askin to autograph a blood-stained napkin
Unfashionable and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line, run it up the flagpole
with Elton, see if he's cool with it, don't stand there and look stupid at
me bitch, I ain't in the mood for this shit, get my dick, Google it
'til it pops up, y'all are so motherfuckin full of shit that you're stopped up
Me I'm always shittin diarrhea of the mouth 'til your speakers crap out - huh, what?
Girl you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette {*chk-chigga-ret*}
But you won't get a hot fudge sundae from me so do not strut my way slut because

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
And now that I got your panties in a bunch and your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came so you stop askin me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut cunt whore, I know you want more
Bitch it's time to put the "math" back in the Mathers cause I'm a fuckin (problem) run boy
Every flow got it mastered so every last word that you fuckin fags heard
comes straight from the fish's ass, yeah in other words I'm a bass-turd
Lookin at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank, yeah still plenty
No morals are instilled in me, so remorse I really don't feel any
Eat your heart out Hannibal, understandable why you're jealous, fuck an animal
I got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now can you hoe?
"Shady I don't understand your flow," understand my flow?
Bitch I flow like Troy Polamalu's hair boy; don't you dare try to follow or compare boy
I'm raw, you ain't even medium-rare, stay the fuck out of my hair boy
You can look, you can stare, point but you can't touch, I'm too (clairvoyant)
I don't get it man, is there a void? All this weak shit, what am I steroids?
Well bitch I'm back with some shit for that ass and your trunk, elephant (hemorrhoids)
And remember boys

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Thank you for coming out!
Hope you enjoyed the show
'Til next time, haha
Peace {*echoes*}</pre>
