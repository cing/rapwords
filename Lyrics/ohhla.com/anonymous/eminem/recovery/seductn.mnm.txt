Artist: Eminem
Album:  Recovery
Song:   Seduction
Typed by: nmielnik@gmail.com

[Samples behind Eminem]
Like a verbal seduction when
Seduction when I tell her...Girls on the shore
Girl, Girl, Girl...Right Now...Girls on the shore
Girl, Girl, Girl...Like a verbal seduction when...Girls on the shore
Girls on the shore...

[Eminem]
I don't know man, it just feels like...we're a lot different
I kinda feels like...I'm on a whole different page right now, than you
It feels strange but um...but I guess it's kinda like...it's kinda like

[Eminem]
I feel like I'm morphin'
Into something that's so incredible that I'm dwarfin'
All competitors
Better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare
Endorphines I affect
Your self-esteem shatters his dialect
Comes blastin out ya deck, she loves me
Such passion you'd expect
This sort of reaction, from her yet
You're stronger, you're fuck'n corny
You try to turn...your charm on
Cuz you just think you're 'bishop the Don Juan
But if you think you're fucking with me, homie you're on one
I'm cock'n my head back like Ed Lover, come on son
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
You're boys are like, "She's fuck'n with dude, she wants 'em"
Oh boy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick cuz I spit better than you
What you expect her to do?
How you expect her to act in the sack?
When she's close'n her eyes
Fantasizing her diggn' her nails in my back to this track

[Chorus]
[Eminem] + (Samples)
Seduction, Seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do          (It's like a verbal seduction when...)
Cuz one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you                       (It's like a verbal seduction when...)
Seduction, Seduce                                (Seduction when I got girls on the shore...)
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cuz one minute she loves you, the next she don't (I got girls on the shore...)
She's been stolen from you                       (It's like a verbal seduction when...)

[Eminem]
She's sitting there gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
There's a 7 disc CD changer in the car
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not (Aw!)
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet (a star!)
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhym'n one syllable (Naw!)
Switch it up, and watch them haters not give it up
Cuz they just not good enough, but I'm not givin up
Til I get my respect, and I won't stop til I get enough
Cuz I'm not livin up to my own expectations (Aw!)
That hater alarm is sound'n, ah, but Obama took the bomb from my name (Oa!)
So quit crying that I took your dame homie, she my dame (aw!)
You're sadly mistaken if you think'n that I'm not on my game boy
And thangs, just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard-on for me, what you holler'n my name for
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man I can't call it

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
It's like we're playin'n lyrical tug of war with your ear
You hear it, girl come here, put your ear up to the speaker
Dear, while I freak this...world premier
Seducin' her, loosen' up with a little freestyle, what-wa wait am I'm lose'n ya?
Am I makin you look bad? 
Well I got news for your homie you're lose'n her
Oh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast, I'ma try to show ya how
Let me slow it (down some)
It's still gonna be a blowout, you're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage something
To see if you can save any of it, bu-but none of it's fuck'n with me
Prick you really feel'n that bullshit, you think you kill'n them syllables
Quit play'n, these beats ain't nothing to fool with 
They call me Fire Marshall, I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round (Woo!)
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome, and you are just awe-struck
She's love stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From suck'n my dick, aw fuck

[Chorus]</pre>
