Artist: Eminem f/ P!nk
Album:  Recovery
Song:   Won't Back Down
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't, back, down!
Oh no I won't, back, down!
Oh no

[Eminem]
Cadillac Sevilles, Coupe DeVilles, brain-dead rims, yeah stupid wheels
Girl I'm too for real, lose your tooth and nail
tryin to fight it, try to deny it, stupid you will feel
What I do I do at will, shootin from the hip, yeah boy shoot to kill
Half a breath left, on my death bed, screamin "F that," yeah super ill!
Baby what the deal? We can chill, split a half a pill and a Happy Meal
Fuck a steak slut, I'll cut my toes off and step on the receipt, 'fore I foot the bill
Listen garden tool, don't make me introduce you to my power tool, you know the fuckin drill
How you douche bags feel knowin you're disposable? Summer's Eve, Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal, baby crank this shit cause it's your goddamn jam
You say that you want your punchlines a little more compact, well shorty I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium and said, "Settle your fuckin ass down, I'm ready for combat man!"
Get it? Calm Batman? Nah, ain't nobody who's as bomb and as
nuts, lines are like mom's CAT scans cause they fuckin go ba-na-nas
Honey I applaud that ass, swear to God man these broads can't dance
Ma, show 'em how it's done, spaz like a goddamn Taz, yeah

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Girl shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's, make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers
playin with an Etch A Sketch, bet ya that you'll never guess who's knockin at your doors
People hit the floors, yeah tonight ladies you gon' get divorced
Girl forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads with Chris's force like you pissed him off!
Talented with the tongue muh'fucker, you ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin licks like I'm robbin liquor stores, makin cash registers, shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest? I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin on your kitchen floor
Other words I'm off the meat rack, bring the beat back, bring me two extension cords
I'ma measure my dick, shit I need six inches more, fuck my dick's big
Bitch, need I remind you, that I don't need the fuckin swine flu, to be a sick pig?
You're addicted, I'm dope, I'm the longest needle around here, need a fix ock?
I'm the big shot, get it dick snots? You're just small pokes, little pricks (hah!)
Girl you think that other prick's hot? I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
'fore I sit back and let him get hotter, better call the cops on him quick-fast
Shady's right back on your bitch-ass, white trash with a half a six-pack
in his hatchback, trailer hitch a-ttached to the back ("dispatch")

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Bitch am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin? Does a bird chirp?
Does Lil Wayne slurp syrup 'til he burps and smoke purp? Does a word search
get, circles wrapped around it like you do when I come through?
I'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck I can do 
when I'm on the mic, girl you're the kind of girl that I can take a likin to
Psych I'm spikin you, like a football, been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch, with a shitty spouse, got a pretty mouth, and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the woodgrain, don't want no cum stain, bitch you listening?
Tryin to turn me down, slut I'm talkin to you, turn me back up! Are you insane?
Tryin to talk over me, in the car? Shut the fuck up while my shit's playing!
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the sayin? Where there's thunder there's light-
-ning and they say that it never strikes twice in the same place then
how the fuck have I been hit six times in three different locations on four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stankin ass that I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho-path, poison ivy wouldn't have me thinkin rash
So hit the dance floor cutie while I do my duty on this microphone, shake your booty
Shorty I'm the shit, why you think Proof used to call me Doody?

[Chorus]</pre>
