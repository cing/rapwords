[Eminem]
There I go.. thinkin of you again

[Chorus]
You, don't, know, how, sick, you, make, me
You make me fuckin sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you, I puke!
You, must, just, not, know-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you, I puke!

[Verse 1]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable, for this type of song - whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I can think of
Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink ta
So fuck it I'ma start right here, I'll just be briefer
Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two, ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooh
I'm sittin here, with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim, shiii-iii-iii-iit
If you only knew, how much I hated you
For every motherfuckin thing you've ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standin here cryin over you, booo-ooo-ooo-ooo-hoo

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter, that you'd probably just shred up - yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta
A stupid piece'a - paper I'd rather let you see how
much I fuckin hate you in a freestyle
You're a fuckin cokehead slut I hope you fuckin die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fuckin guts you fuckin slut I hope you die, die-ie-ie-ie-ie-ie-ie!
But please don't get me wrong - I'm not bitter I'm mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yak, aaa-aaa-aaaak
But when else can I do, I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I just move on I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you, now all I wanna do, is puuu-uuu-uuuke!

[Chorus]
