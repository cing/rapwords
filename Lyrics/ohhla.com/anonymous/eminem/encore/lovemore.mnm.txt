Artist: Eminem
Album:  Encore (Bonus CD)
Song:   Love You More
Typed by: r_eduardo_h45@hotmail.com {with help from liner notes}

[Eminem]
Still love me?  Take this {*guns cocked*}
You ready?  One, two, three! {*two shots*}

[Chorus: Eminem]
The more you, put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me?  I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 1]
It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust, cause neither one of us trust each other
So we fuck 'til we bust and we cuss each other, out
We know what it's about, SHOUT
'til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fistfight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin here with you
There ain't nothin anyone could ever say or ever do cause

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good - cause you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry
It makes me, wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
in our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spred rumors
But they ain't got proof, if they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, cause any chick can say that she screwin me
But you gotta believe me to a degree cause true indeed
if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin.. yeah I would
Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
that would be this soft and warm
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know, that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope, the only reason that I cope is cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh why must we try, is it really so rough
that we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs
We're lyin to ourselves, that's the beauty of it geah
Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent up rage
we both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged
by someone else, we've both been with someone else
And someone else's problems neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin it all the time
On every song, every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoop-la, all the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love
you wouldn't do what, you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
this time, cause this time girl I'm tellin you what
You do it again I'm fuckin you up

[Outlude]
No matter what you say, or what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you, in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers, and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
So when you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out, you can't escape me whore

[Chorus]</pre>
