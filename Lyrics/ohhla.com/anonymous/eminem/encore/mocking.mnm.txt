Yeah...
I know sometimes, things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier - stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin about?  You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
when I'm gone but I'm tryin to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin, wipe them tears, daddy's here no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney, Uncle's crazy ain't he yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got it this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
I try to keep up sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
the harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me
All the things growin up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein
together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin that we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
 
[Chorus]
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold, ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
and said some of 'em weren't from me, cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night cryin
Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom, was savin money for you in a jar
Tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back
on the Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
and met Dr. Dre, and flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seein daddy on the TV
And momma didn't like it, and you and Laney were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscin
Lookin at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
 
[Chorus]

[Eminem]
And if you ask me to daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with dad
Ha ha! </pre>
