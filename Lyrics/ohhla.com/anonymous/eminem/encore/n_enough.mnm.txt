Song:   Never Enough
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash {with help from liner notes}

[Eminem]
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Drezy'll
have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit I layed to tape 'fore they erase me
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
twenty times cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
like I'm going too fast cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushin up daisies and gone
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I the heavenly gates, I'd be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die-hard fan who embrace me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom, far as she raised me
in a neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me, what I am today see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryin to strip me of my credibility or make me look fake G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been savin
to say to me, you had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out, and try to about face me
Cause I've been patiently waitin for the day
that we finally meet, in the same place to see

[Chorus 2X: Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MC's I eat up
Ohhhh, it's never enough

[50 Cent]
My flow's untouchable, now you gotta face it
Uh-oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You gon', say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
The smell of victory love it so much I can taste it
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit, graze it
Your peace talk, save it, your shit sounds, dated
You're over-rated, I'm obli-gated, to
study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin attention boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss shit
To be specific I go ballistic it's hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play you ain't gotta sniff it
Shoot it or pop it, roll it bag it or chop it
It get you high over and over but you gotta cop it
When it's hot it's hot, your hatin is undeniable, stop it

[Chorus]
