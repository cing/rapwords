Yeahhh..
Definitely - definately, definately dope
Definitely - definately K-Mart, yeah
Yeah {*farts*}

[Eminem]
You find me offensive; I find you offensive for finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw out or line any fences; if so
to what extents if any should I go?  Cause it's getting expensive 
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage
to the brain when I go to lengths; this
far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too God damned sensitive
It's censorship and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this
And Christo-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me I even believe I
had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must of put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman I killed Super-man, and how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic

[Chorus]
Cause I ain't got no legs, or no brain
Nice to meet you, hi my name is...
I forgot my name!
My aim was not to become what I became; with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil - my new name is...
Rain Man

[Eminem]
Now in the bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed, have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse
for your actions; either before during or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids, in a more derogatory way
But who's to say, what's fair to say
And what not to say, let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre (what up?) I got a question if I may (yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend (yeah)
And watch his butt butt when he tees off (yeah)
But uh, I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hut hut
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant, it was just an accident
But he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt
Is that gay?  I just need to clear things up
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut, because

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is tellin me Spider-Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whoop ass canister
God damnit Dre, where's the God damned beat (yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yup yup, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's ass and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon I
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can and zoom I 
Headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
And I don't even gotta make no God damned sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit!

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Cause AHH-AHH-AHH-AHH-AHH!
Yup, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre
Super dope, beatmaker
Two thousand, two thousand four-hundred and eighty-seven million
Nine hundred and se-seventy-three thousand four hundred and sixty-three..
.. seventy</pre>
