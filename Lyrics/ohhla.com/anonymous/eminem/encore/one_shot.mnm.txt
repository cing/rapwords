Artist: Eminem f/ D-12
Album:  Encore
Song:   One Shot 2 Shot
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash {with help from liner notes}

{*gun shots, crowd screaming*}
I told y'all motherfuckers I was comin back (oh shit)
What now nigga, what now?  What?  Brewster Projects nigga

[Chorus: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin shots off

[Bizarre]
Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm tryin to run and get my motherfuckin gun
(Nigga what about yo' wife?) Nigga fuck my wife
I'm tryin to run and save my motherfuckin life
Oh, shit!  The shooter's comin
Bitches hollerin, niggaz runnin
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm tryin to make it to the St. Andrew's door
{hey man) {*chk-chk-BOOM*} That's the sound of the glock
Even DJ Houseshoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around, and forget my tec
I don't see nobody, but Fat Five and Hex

[Eminem] Kuniva you aight?
[Kuniva] These niggaz is trippin
[Eminem] Where's Bizarre at?

[Kuniva]
I'm tryin to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin everywhere and niggaz is whylin
Two minutes ago we was all jokin and smilin
This chick is clingin on to me, sobbin and sighin
Sayin she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin
But it's real and it's on and caps is gettin peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield and
{*blam* AHH!} She got hit and now she's yellin {DON'T LEAVE ME!}
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late!

[Chorus]

[Kon Artis] I been tryin to call you all day motherfucker where you at?
[Swifty Mc] I'm on 7 Mile {*gunfire*} what the fuck was that?
[Swifty Mc] {*gunfire*} Damn, somebody hit me from the back!
[Kon Artis] What with they car?
[Swifty Mc] With a gat nigga, and my tire flat
[Swifty Mc] {*crash*} And I just hit a pole, them niggaz some hoes
[Kon Artis] Is you hit?
[Swifty Mc] I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
[Swifty Mc] It was a black Mitsubishi
[Kon Arist] Shit, that's the click we beefin with
[Swifty Mc] Maaaaan!
[Kon Artis] I swear

[Swifty McVey]
And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leavin a carcass today
And I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up!

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleepin outside the door, waitin in line still
tryin to get inside the club to see D-12 perform
The fire marshalls know, the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd
fans and some cumwad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aimin for, six feet away is the door
into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flyin all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, havin a mazeltov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von?  He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the fuck?  Oh my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, bein trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
{*blam*} God damn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again I can't do it
I scoop D, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
made it to the front door and collapsed
on the steps looked up and I seen Swift
Shootin it out but I can't see who he's shootin it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezin his four-fifth

[Chorus]

[Kon Artis]
Yo, it's a Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left, hand Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight cause I'm poppin niggaz tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryin to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
that shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (bitch bring me a bottle of Mo')
I just wanna know who drivin the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

[Chorus]
