Artist: Eminem
Album:  Relapse
Song:   Crack a Bottle
Typed by: eckostylez@gmail.com

[Intro]
Oooh! Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds, with a record of 17 rapes, 400
assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world, Slim Shady!

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr Dre

[Verse One]
They see that low rider go by there, like "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl
Decisions, decisions garage looks like precision collision
Or maico beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's son who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts
They disgust, me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name n haters get murked
Bitches lust man they love me when I lay in the cut
Missed the cut the lady give a raidy some paper cut
Now picture us It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse and worse cause your soft
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the same repetition is true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol The platinum dude is back on you hoes

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
It's sorta like pourin' Draino down a live volcano
You never know what'll happen next, it may blow
Same thing happens to the beats when Dre blows
I talk shit, but my dick's long as my payroll
I get ass like a ball player, but I'm a boss player
Pimpin' hoes from here to Australia
Till I get heart failure
Look at ya half of ya'll, all scared
Other half, hands up in the air, like "Awww yeah"
This is our year, this is what you call sheer talent,
But I think at this point it's just obvious
Fierce, they say my music's good for all queers
Cuz I make your ear ring, get it?, piercin' all ears
Call us the mafia We got the fucking mob here
Gimme the hate and I'll feed off of ya's all year
Shit, I'm just doing my job here
You don't want no problem, do ya?
Fuck it, I'll even crack a bottle for ya

[Chorus]</pre>
