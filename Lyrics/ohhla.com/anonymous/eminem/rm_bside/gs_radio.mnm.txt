Artist: Eminem f/ Dr Dre
Album:  Guilty Conscience CD Single
Song:   Guilty Conscience (Radio/Video Edit)
Typed by: brianrancourt@hotmail.co.uk, OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash *

* this is the EDITED song version
  words that were blanked w/o being replaced are in {}'s

{Sound of static}

[Announcer]
Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old.
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
he decides to rob a liquor store.
("I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes")
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play...

[Dr. Dre]
Alright, stop! (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your mother{fuckin'} conscience

[Eminem]
That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with an aged razor blade

[Dr. Dre]
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighbourhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns

[Eminem]
Funk that! Do that {shit}! Hit that lick!
Can you afford to blow this pit? Are you that rich?
Why you care if you scare her to death? Are you that chick?
Do you really think she gives a {fuck} you have kids?

[Dr. Dre]
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it! (You're right!)
Not over this list

[Eminem]
Stop!

[Dr. Dre]
Drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you

[Eminem]
You know what Dre? I don't like your attitude!

[Sung]
These voices, these voices!
I hear them! (hear them, hear them, hear them)!
I'll follow!
I'll follow!
I'll follow!
I'll follow all these voices!

<The sung part repeats as the announcer talks over it>

[Anouncer]
Meet Stan, twenty-one years old.
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play.

<singing part stops>

[Eminem]
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
and smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little chicken's earlobe!

[Dr. Dre]
Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old
How could you take advantage of her?
She's passed out!

[Eminem]
It's easy, just cut these lights out!
That's how!
Then pick this chicken up
Get her off Brad's couch
And leave her on the front porch
At her mum and dad's house!

[Dr. Dre]
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie "Kids"?

[Eminem]
No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest (Doobiest)!

[Dr Dre]
Do you wanna get hauled off to jail?

[Eminem]
Funk that, drop her off, ring the door bell then bail.

[Sung]
These voices, these voices!
I hear them! (hear them, hear them, hear them)!
I'll follow!
I'll follow!
I'll follow!
I'll follow all these voices!

<The sung part repeats as the announcer talks over it>

[Anouncer]
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
he walks in the door of his trailer park home
to find his wife in bed with another man.

<singing part stops>

[Dr. Dre]
Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'

[Eminem]
Start breathin'?!
Man, you just caught your wife cheatin'!
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?!
Forget gettin' divorced!
CUT THIS CHICKEN'S HEAD OFF!!!

[Dr. Dre]
Wait! What if there's a good explanation for this?

[Eminem]
What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his {dick}?!

[Dr. Dre]
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

[Eminem]
Okay! Thought about it, still wanna grab her?
Kick her out the house, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped DEE BARNES??!

[Dr. Dre]
What'chu say?

[Eminem]
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?

[Dr. Dre]
I'ma kill you, you little mother...!

[Eminem](Interupting)
Uhhh-aahh! Temper temper!
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton 'n' y'all better make way?
How in the hell you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

[Dr. Dre]
'Cause he don't need to go the same rap that I went
Been there, done that.. aw {fuck} it...
What am I sayin? Do 'em both Grady, where's your gun at?

{gun fires, is cocked, and re-fired} </pre>
