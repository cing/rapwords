Artist: Eminem f/ 50 Cent, Ca$his, Dr. Dre, Jay-Z, Stat Quo
Album:  Syllables 12"
Song:   Syllables
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro]
It is not about lyrics anymore!
It's about a hot beat, and a catchy hook!

[Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and, A-B-C it
then so be it, cause nowadays these kids
Jeez, don't give a shit 'bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ's playin them hits
"Oh this my jam, this my shit!
We don't know a word to a verse, all we know is the chorus
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us"
And the song's ginormous, the whole formula's switched
cause we don't know anymore what are hits
Is it the beat? Is it the rap?
Is it a finger snap or the same 8-0-8 clap?
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
when 13-year olds control the remotes?
And Ashlee's got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-phas-is on our syl-la-lables

[Jay-Z]
If the emphasis on a compact disc
isn't a beat then I'm gon' feature Em and get rich
and let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Rove'
Cause e'rywhere I go they love the bling-bling flow
The bang-bang, look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing' cost Jermaine a lot of dough (oh)
The fuck am I bustin my brain fo'?
It's just the way the game go, and oh it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow? You bought the shit!
I guess you to blame too, I just found the angle
Hehe, no more reality flows
I'm tryin to time my album droppin with a reality show
Cock the mac-11 front of Hot 97
And call my publicist, tell her we in press heaven
Hehe, no one gives a shit except
some kids that just got into sex on the internet
So you want the chat room or the house in Malibu?
Em, your emphasis is on the wrong syl-la-lable

[Dr. Dre]
Jay said 30's the new 20, funny
Must mean 40's the new 30, interestin
Cause ever since then it's been in essence an extension
for veteran rappers that are better than half of
the shit comin out right now, it's all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it's his last, then 50 and Em
Then what? "Detox" drops, what do we got then?
So now our whole camps is runnin around, scramblin
over what to do, gamblin
Every time we put a record out just lookin for that hook

[Em] Wait Dre, look~!

[Chorus: Eminem - singing]
Shorty I love youuuuuuu
And you loooove me tooooooo
We were meant to be
Cause shorty you love meeeeeee
And I loooove you tooooooo
And I promise I'll be true to you

[50 Cent]
Go shorty, it's your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
It's the kid that flip flows who used to flip O's
I run G for days, you should see how I get hoes
I'm international, I get my dick licked 'round the globe
I'm sick right into shows when ridin on lo-lo's
Puffin on cocoa, my bitch in Manolo's
Don't fuck with the dodos, that's slang for dumb hoes
Think I'm playin I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around you could get yo' ass smoked, loc
It's not a game, me B, I ain't playin
Be behind me playa, so you here anyway
You don't hear what I'm sayin, me finini-nay
Fee-fideedee-day, just give me my check then I'll be on my way
Sonny bunny money you're funny
You ain't even listenin and I just took your money

[Stat Quo]
There once was a time everywhere he turned
Shady/Aftermath was all you heard
But they said 50 sang too much and Em got soft
And they said Dre just fell the fuck off
Well fuck the fuck-offs, all y'all eat salt
Be mad, we back fresh up out of the vault, oh!
New syl-la-lables, eat balls you fuck-offs
Yo' house, yo' bitch, I'm gettin sucked off
East, South, Midwest, even up North
Fallin victim to wax spittin, bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can, I'm runnin past while y'all walk

[Ca$his]
Shady made me for bringin it back
For the history of rap, it's gone with a snap
A snare, and a clap
What happened to just spittin 'bout livin in the muh'fuckin city you at?
In the grimiest condition, I breathe in drama
King Mathers and Ca$h meet, that's freak karma
I'm everything anything you could never be
It's a hittin, rhymin a month deep in the beat
I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done to mine
No rest, contest, contract is signed
By blood I'm in this squad for life
Air out my windpipes and, I just chime
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
I'm crazy, "Renagade" like Em and Jay-Z
I'm Rosemary's baby, I want you to hate me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
It is not about lyrics anymore {*2X*}
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat {*2X*}
A hot-hot-hot beat, and a catchy hook {*2X*}
Nobody gives a damn about them syllables, syl-la-lables
Whatever they are
I don't care if they gotta rhyme Schmoe, moe, Joe, toe and flow
Now get out there and sell some Goddamn records! {*repeat to fade*}</pre>
