Artist: Eminem
Album:  Difficult 12"
Song:   Difficult (Proof Tribute)
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Eminem]
They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they askin me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me?
Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinely care?
Doody, most of my life it's just been me and you there
And I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say "I love you" as much as I wanted to but I do
Yeah, I say it now and you can't hear me
What the fuck good does that do me now? But somehow I know you're near me
Your presence; oh I went and dropped some presents off for Easter
to them, two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their
minds a little and dawg you'll never believe this
But Sharonda, actually talks to me now, Jesus!
And everyone else is just tryin to pick up the pieces
Man how could you touch so many fuckin lives and just leave us?
They say grievance has its way of affectin everyone different
If it's, true, how the fuck I'm 'sposed to get over you?
Difficult as it sounds...

[Eminem]
Yo, yeah
Doody - that's what we called each other
I don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us, we was always brothers
Never thought about each other's, skin colors
'Til one day we was walkin up the block in the summer
It was like 90 degrees, I was catchin a sunburn
Tryin to walk under the trees just to get me some comfort
I'm moanin, I just wanna get home and I look over
and your shirt is off, I'm like "You're gonna fry"; you're like, "No I won't I'm
Black stupid! And Black people they got melatonin
in their skin, we don't burn!" Meanwhile my face is glowin
And I feel like I'm on fire, and the entire time you're just laughin at me
And snappin at me with your shirt bastard
And I have to get you back for that shit
And by the way them playboy rings my mother stole from you
Well Nate finally got 'em back, shit
That musta been at least 16 years ago, well I put 'em in your cask-oww
Movin past it, it still ain't registered yet
But you can bet, your legacy they'll never forget
The Motor City Motown, hip-hop vet
Hip Hop Shop dreads, it don't stop there
Yeah, as difficult as it sounds...

[Eminem]
Yeah, and this may sound a little strange but I'ma tell it
I found a jacket that you left at my wedding, I picked it to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass and
hang it up in the hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all of me and D12, we feel like "Fuck rap"
It feels like our general just fuckin died in our lap
We shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed, our two-ways
are in the trash so some cats'll have to find a new way
And I know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is they're all still here, and you ain't
Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressin on
Don't ever give up the dream dawg, I got love for you all
And Doody, it's true you brought people together 
who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peace-maker Doody, I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
But you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin
If it had to happen it had to happen - believe me
I know you're the one who taught me to throw dem 'bows back on Dresden
From eggin cars to paintballin, gettin arrested
to sittin across from each other in cells laughin and jestin
They tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court
so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin
Me, you and - what's his face? I forgot his fuckin name
Shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed 
our team and if I see him again I'ma punch him in the fuckin face
and that's on Hailie Jade, Whitney Lane, and Alaina's name
I'll let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot
in the air for you and pour some liquor out
with Obie in the parkin lot, of 54 just before
we were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more
Difficult as it sounds...</pre>
