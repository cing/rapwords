Artist: Eminem f/ Gwen Stefani
Album:  Southpaw soundtrack
Song:   Kings Never Die
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die...

[Eminem]
I can hear the drummer drummin, and the trumpets, someone's
tryna summon someone, I know somethin's comin, but I'm runnin from it
To be standin at the summit and plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was, was it
too good to be true? Have nothin, get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, then I swallow hallucinogens
Cause if not, where the hell did it go? Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den
by the dutch oven just choosin to sin
Even if it means I'm sellin my soul, just to be the undisputed again, do whatever I gotta do just to win
Cause I got this muh'fuckin cloud over my head, crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't, think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that I'm somehow now back to the underdog but no matter how loud that
I bark, this sport is somethin I never bow-wow'd at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout
It's a love-hate, but I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about is drivin around town with my fuckin whereabouts in a doubt
Cause, I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit or shit or stepped on but kept goin
I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
Cause you're movin onto the next, but is your respect gone?
Cause someone told me that

[Gwen Stefani]
Kings never die...

[Eminem]
Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire
to dig deep, nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way, I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features
and try to show out on a track with me - but it'd actually
have to be a fuckin blowout to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die, I know shit has changed in this age
Fuck a Twitter page, did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's drivin me crazy, I'm ridin shotgun tryna get a gauge
on what's hot, but I'm not gonna conform, better stay
passin this, shit and opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
if I stay passionate, maybe I can stay Jay miraculous, come back as if I went away
But detractors just say some bullshit for the +Renegade+
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure, here I go again, to the stage
and I feel like I'm in a cage - they so want a champion to fall
I still wonder why I laugh at 'em cause why carry when I'm all so - fuck what these cynics say!
It just goes to show that, when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again that I'll act as if I'm posted up with this pent-up rage
Cause - cause all these plaques in my office, on the floor stacked against the door
All be just metaphors for the odds of, when you comin back again cause all
the accomplishments, accolades, awards and trophies, just don't mean jack anymore
Cause I'm here today and, gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be

[Chorus]

[Eminem - begins over last line of Chorus]
I want it, I'm comin to get it so you son-of-a-bitches don't duck, you're gonna get riddled full
Critics all end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked
And, I ain't stoppin 'til, I'm on top again, all alone and, on a throne
Like a token of respect or a homage, poem or an ode, I've been on
Tossed in the air by my own arm and launched so hard I broke my collarbone
And when it's my, time to go, I'm still not leaving
Stop for no one, I don't know but, I've been told a, obstacle that
blocks your road to, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold cause
They say kings never die, just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly; so hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold up and provoke these moments
Cause in the blink of an eye, they'll be overrrr
Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur and ensure
that nobody's ever gonna be what you were, so before you're leavin this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berzerk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work, plus I'm thinkin that they're
mistakin my kindness for weakness, distill it with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Purina{?} to flippin burgers on the grill for some peanuts
From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silver screen where Rocky stepped with the demons, Khalil on the beat cause
Makin the beat ain't the same feelin to me is killin the beat, it's overfillin to me, it's what fillin a seat is
That sound, vomit, thirst and how common underground commons eat
Outsider stomach growl, throbbin hunger, out-rhymin everyone, God just give me
one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever, entertainin even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear me say I ain't

[Chorus]

[Outro: Gwen Stefani]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oooooh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oooooh
Oh, oh
Kings never die</pre>
