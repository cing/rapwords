Artist: Eminem f/ Slaughterhouse, Yelawolf
Album:  2.0 Boys 12"
Song:   2.0 Boys
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Eminem]
Ohh! Told you! Game over!

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Uhh, Ryan's a homicidal misfit
I write the solution to biophysics on the side on a cliff in some heiroglyphics
This my admission to havin violent psychotic wit
Devour polish it, politics
By the way I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower tip
I like writin but I will stick this pencil in ya ass before I write ya shit
Pause, inhalin hella kush
Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot, gas pedal push
Felons crooks, goin door to door like we sellin books
Dolly Parton style, melons mushed
Now my bitch dancer, I'm 'bout as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style you'd probably rip ya pants up
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
it probably'll smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me anchor man, I hold down the ship
Leave you niggaz floatin in water then go and drown a fish
Fuck! I'm fuckin heinous, I'll make you fuckin famous
Them lead showers is comin, fuck is you sayin?

[Eminem]
FUCK, it's fuckin rainin; SHIT, it's lightning
BITCH, it's thunderin, cause I'm cussin up a storm if you wonderin
Shit, SHIT! You couldn't muster up enough thought
to take a dump turd or brain fart, jump if you want
Urine in your face, all you had to do was say
that you wish you would've just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolize the game, Illuminati is here
Yeah, human oddities, at odds with us just why it's gotta be
Cause we started out cold and it snowballed, we froze
Soon as we rolled up, on these hoes
Alls we is know y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are
So quit fuckin the dog 'fore we start callin you Bizarre
Shit, screwed the pooch, y'all done raped the Pitbull
Fell in love with a Shih Tzu, this missile's directed directly at you
And as for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint
You must be huffin, fuck a ball sack if your taints can't take you on a date
You mistake me for a gentleman, you're 2000-and-late
Man I'm will.i.AIN'T!
I'm the bad guy, type of guy that'll drag five 
girls up on stage, pour ice in their pants, and the first one who +Peas+, gets a +Black Eye+!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Must be out of your mind
You think you're fuckin with us
Suck on these nuts
Bitch hang it up, this game is over

[Joell Ortiz]
Puffin loosies watchin "I Love Lucy" with Gary Busey - crazy!
How the fuck could you son me? I'm Shady!
Will there ever come a day where they could slay me?
I don't know; fifth month, black and yellow insect, May bee/maybe!
'Til then I kill the bad man tryna slay me
E'rything you kick weak, you speak kung fu-gazi
All my homeboys, 2.0 boys
Nickel I just picked up a Phantom, look how it Rolls, Royce!
Even if I wanted to quit I ain't got no choice
Verses keep comin, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoists
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain mayne, so moist
Bang bang, bang bang! House Gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussies, don't ask what we came for
I write 'til my right arm vein's sore
Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war
You hear that YAOWA you know who finna file out
Definitively finish you, my fist stick out that agua
Piranha mentality with a Jaws bite all night
Comin up never saw light but never lost sight

[Joe Budden]
Jets and movers, cesspool-ers, meth abusers
Wish death to us, tecs rugers to respect they shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Must move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to nay hood, bigger than 'jects
Cheated death multiple times without riggin the deck
So I'm well-prepped if you just want war
There'll be blood e'rywhere, you'd be layin on the Louboutin floor
It's raw, but keep actin like you don't know Mouse nigga
And you gon' need the best doctors, House nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light you'll be in the carpool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate
I'm Martin King starin at a picture of Obama's face
Talkin funds, niggaz ain't never seen stock
I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
Take off, you invited inside of the mind of a psychotic rhymer
I'm kind of a - Dahmer!
I'm grindin up rappers, I'm linin up jackers, I'm climbin up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I'm the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun to split you to particles (particles)
Tell me when and I'm there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like unlimited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don't fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it's comin from?
You stepped on #2, just to be #1
Now I'ma step on you, bring it to yo' yard
Bogart for ours, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the West
I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart

[Yelawolf]
I got Jim Beam in the liver, gettin head like clean clippers
With haters on my dick like a jean zipper
But I throw up 16's like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well BITCH you ain't seen sicker
Then I'll, crack and then I'll hop around in a hospital gown
Poppin the trunk, my pumper stay cockin the rounds
I shit logs and I piss, river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that's as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fuckin ignorant
Shit with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playin
Skinny ass, pants saggin, it's only yourself you're playin
Call me a clown but you love what the clown's sayin
in them freak shows at the county carnival, then you payin
Bitch I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark yellin "Go Shady!"
Drivin slower than an old lady
In an old '89, no piece if you pay me
Give me peace sign on my grille, no Mercedes
I'm gettin paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago would've broken most of you crazy
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lady!
You ain't fuckin with Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce
You don't wanna see the Crooked I, or listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the point-oh boys
And if Marshall want me to clap then homie I'll deploy
Game over!

[Marshall] Yo I don't think they heard you, tell 'em again
[Yelawolf] Game over!
[Marshall] Ha ha</pre>
