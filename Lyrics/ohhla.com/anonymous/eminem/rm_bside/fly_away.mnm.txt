Artist: Eminem f/ Just Blaze
Album:  Fly Away 12"
Song:   Fly Away
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Chorus: Just Blaze]
Some people ask me, where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
And play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted, and try to play me
First I'll come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, say I'm crazy
Ask what I think, and I say maybe
I'll fly awayyyyy (fly awayyyyy)
It ain't nuttin in my way so I may as well fly awayyyyy (fly awayyyyy)
It ain't nuttin else to say so I may as well fly awayyyyy (fly awayyyyy)
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon' die todayyyyy (die todayyyyy)
Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go (go)
And the only way to see me is if you lookin up from down below (down below)
And there's nuttin else to say so I may as well fly awayyyyy (yea-yeah-ye-e-e-eah)
And there's nuttin in my way so I may as well fly awayyyyy (yea-yeah-ye-e-e-eah)
I'm on top of this thing so I may as well fly away, ay-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
Yeah

[Eminem]
Got my self-esteem back, got my confidence up
I'ma step up on the stage now, I'm gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hangin off of my butt
And you ain't 'bout to tell me nothin boy, get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money, two for the show
My shit don't stink, I don't think so
Wipe my ass with the tissue and roll it back up in the roll
Are you ready now? Here we go
The bald eagle has landed
I'm back in your hair, sorry for leavin you stranded
I'm twice as dreaded, evil and rancid
They can't sit, I don't think anybody understands it
Especially when the world's silly putty in your hands it's
Play-Doh, I ain't back to play though
They said he died in a fatal, car crash, shows what they know
Shit if I did, it'd be a trailer not a car, the white trash star
I fuck an RV up like Brett Favre!
Homie you got it backwards, you're dippin your soup inside your crackers
I can carry rap 'til my back hurts
Set it down, go right back to the chiropractors
Get my back right, then I'm right back on you bastards
I was chasin a dragon, I don't know what happened
It's like that feelin I had when I first started rappin
I just couldn't seem to get back and recapture, that magic
So I went back to the lab, that's where I been at when

[Chorus] - first 1/2

[Just Blaze]
I'll fly awayyyyy (fly awayyyyy)
It ain't nuttin in my way so I may as well fly awayyyyy (fly awayyyyy)
It ain't nuttin else to say so I may as well fly away, ay-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
Yeah

[Eminem]
I took a hiatus haters, now I'm back to cause trouble
Got the fuckin shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles
I'm the {*BOOM*} you ain't fuckin sick, the hospital
won't even give you cough drops for coughs cocksucker
You think you hot? You ain't even lukewarm
My puke's hotter than you, you're soft, I use fire to cool me off
I told 'em I'd grow up one day and show 'em
I'd be able to choke clouds, pick up lightnin bolts and throw 'em
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgie Porgie kissed the girls, make the girls cry for him
Make 'em swarm, make 'em fight over the shirts I've worn
Swoon over my sweat towels, it's mind blowin
Yes I'm livin the dream homie, can't nothin compare
I'm so up, I'm stuck in mid-air, I'm lovin it yeah!
It's like these people are steps now, all they do is stair/stare
These haters are so pussy they're afraid to be scared!
This is payback, like I owe 'em back pay
They spat in my face, now I'm back to do them the same exact WAY
And leave this rap game with a bad taste
And slap it back out before I step back out of this crap, they
slap me now I'm slappin 'em back, hey
Fuck it we're slap happy, yeah okay now we're talkin some smack ay
And I ain't lookin back, in fact they
can stare at my ass crack, how's that for hindsight? What the track say?
