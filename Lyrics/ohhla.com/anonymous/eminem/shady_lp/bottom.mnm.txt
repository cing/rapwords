Artist: Eminem
Album:  Slim Shady LP
Song:   Rock Bottom
Typed by: darnoc20@aol.com

Aiyyo!  
This song is dedicated - to all the happy people
All the happy people - who have real nice lives
And who have no idea what it's like, to be broke as fuck

[Verse One]
I feel like I'm walkin a tight rope, without a circus net
Poppin percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect; but I work and sweat for this worthless check
I'm bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged
and my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin ballers while they flossin in they Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin autograph signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fry's and average half pinters
But playa haters turnin bitch like they have vaginas
Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
when snakes slither in the grass spineless

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
That's Rock Bottom - when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's Rock Bottom - when you want somethin bad enough to steal
That's Rock Bottom - when you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

[Verse Two]
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin things look up; but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Living in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin dead end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play
Cause when we die we know we all going the same way
Cause it's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
I'm comfortable and roomy in a six
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of sess a day
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
There's people that love me, and people that hate me
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbin deceitful and shady
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
if it means I end up burnin in hell scorchin in flames
if it means I'm stealin your checkbook and forgin your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
Cause right now, I feel like just hit the rock bottom
I got problems - now everybody on my blocks got 'em
I'm screamin like them two cops when Tupac shot 'em
Holdin two glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
And them rings you wearin look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flauntin 'em I could be takin 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch, you want 'em?
Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

[Chorus]</pre>
