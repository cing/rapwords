{*baby crying*}

[Eminem]
One thousand different houses and Münchausen
will make you wanna punch out some-fuckin-one, "Ouch!
What the fuck'd you hit me for?" Scream life as I punch counter
And bunches out of anger, I once encountered a stranger, in a dumb gown
Black hood with a scythe, shit I laughed in his face, spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like "Take this
Now get your ass back in that game bitch
Don't take shit for granted and don't take shit - give it"
Only bull you should take is by the horns, a mixture of Whitey Ford
and Mighty Thor, I +Everlast+, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record, replenish, keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it but your pride, that's all you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw, back's to wall
No one was there to catch you fall, you pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls like they're gargantuan and ask yourself how fuckin bad you want it
Pull out your badge for whoopin ass and flash it on 'em
Nobody's gonna back you in the corner, you're a hornet
No one's more ignorant than you fuckin four in the morning
You're at the laboratory, storming like there's nothin that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it!
Girl what would you do if I said your body was off the +chain+
and I told you I smile every single time I +saw+ your face?
I ain't finished bitch, I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play, they say I'm a spoiled lil' baby - but

[Chorus 2X: Eminem]
Nobody puts baby in a corner
I'm only tryin to warn ya
Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin a tantrum
He'll fuckin flip on ya (cause)

[Eminem]
What goes through an addict's brain? Besides static pain
and Big Daddy Kane, great beats and words, an erratic train
of thought like splatter paint, scatter brain
Yeah, maybe that explains why you're back but don't rap the same
And you're lookin way thinner
Cause your hunger got you lookin like they took away dinner {*chuka*} Sugar Ray Leonard
wouldn't sugar coat a fuckin booger though just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a {*chuka*} what {*chuka*} (GOAT)
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
Hope it lands on another rap singer's lips who can't think of shit
Anything of wit that's interesting to spit, show who's king of this fuckin English Lit'
Let your middle fingers flip on each hand, while extending this shit
How low can you go? Lower then Chuck D hoe
Hear the bass of this in my voice? Rocky's back, where my Adrian?
Nobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the Patriots
to rap, not a man, I'm a weapon, who just happened to be a rapper
who just happened to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany in the bathroom
I'd never be the same after, now I'm back with an appe-
-tite for destruction and a fuckin recipe for disaster
So let's eat cause I'm famished, every deed is a dastard-
-ly one, evilest bastard, even you askin for me to be po-
-lite to people, is like me havin my teeth pulled

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
So step inside a dimension - the demented side of a mind that's 
like the inside of an engine, while I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded if I didn't mention, I'll lose my mind and my temper
You'll be the first one who finds I'm offensive
Got him climbin the fences, lost some time to addiction
But look up "rhyme" in the dictio-nary, I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it, I'm an enigma!
Fuck it, let's get to the meat (balls), I'm gonna skip the
veg and potatoes, edumacator
They are shit legends are made of, spit treacherous data
Shit that you would say to
your worst enemy, this wretched is, what you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
Then combine 'em with Method Man and Redman with metham-
-phetamines in each left hand, in each right is a sledgeham-
-mer, and pajamas, standin in front of a webcam
Beatin themselves in the head 'til Russell lets 'em off Def Jam
Maybe I need my head exam'ed, Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
hangin from his ceiling drippin with a bed pan
I need MEDS, swear to God cause if I go off the EDGE
T.I. ain't talkin me off the ledge man!
Heartthrob at a fart, AHH, nah, more like a smart slob
Part blob that'll stab you with a sharp ob-
-ject to the heart and leave claw marks all over the Walmart walls
Little baby with large BALLS!
Fuck mud slingin, I'm blood flingin
There's nothing on this fucking Earth better then being the king of
the playground, I hate the swings but I love bein
an underdog, cause when I'm pushed, I end up swingin (ahh)

[Chorus]
