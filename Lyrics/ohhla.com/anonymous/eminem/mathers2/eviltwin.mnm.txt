Artist: Eminem
Album:  The Marshall Mathers LP 2
Song:   Evil Twin
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, I was tryin to figure out, the difference
But I think, I think the lines are startin to get blurred

[Eminem]
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e, when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged, in these chains and restraints
Grimmin every stranger in the place, while I gaze into space
Cause I'm mentally, rearrangin his face
I need a change of pace - cause the pace I'm workin at's dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roastin 'em
Cause that's where most of my anger is based/baste!
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
I just wanna hurt you, aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanye's, Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's
I'm frustrated cause ain't
no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of wack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm goin all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is I'm strapped
for battles, sucka duck, crawl out the back
It's a bar fight, prepare your arsenal, and beware of bar stools
flyin through the air and bottles breakin, mirrors also
And I ain't stoppin 'til the swear jar's full
"You done called every woman a slut, but you're +Forgetting Sarah, Marshall+"
(Palin!) Oh, my bad, slut
And next time I show up in court, I'll be naked, and just wear a law-suit
Judge be like, "That's sharp, how much that motherfucker cost you?
Smart ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones you, sexy motherfucker
You're so fuckin gravy Marshall; I should start callin you +au jus+
Cause alls you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo"
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change (change) but only for the worse
I coulda changed the world, if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic K-Mart chains panic, cause they can't even spin back the curse words
cause they're worse when they're reversed
Motherfucker! {"Rape your mother, kill your parents"}
And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screamin "fuck, shit, fuck~!" Adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out, I was like "Merits?
Fuck that! I'd rather be loud and I like swearin"
From the first album, even the gals were like "Tight lyrics
Dreamy eyes," but my fuckin mouth was nightmarish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and
opposition felt the opposite, sometimes I listen
and revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches
to make sure I keep up with my competition
Haha, hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines - where I'm at
And the way I feel now, feel like I might just strike first, then ignore the replies

[Chorus: Eminem] + {Royce Da 5'9" sample}
There's darkness closin in {"Evil twin"}
There it goes again {"My Evil twin"}
It controls my pen {"Evil twin"}
But that ain't me, it's my evil twin
{"Then I step out and see my Evil twin; he gives me an evil grin"}
But he's just a friend {"Evil twin"}
Who, pops up now and again {"Evil twin"}
So don't blame me {"Evil twin"}
Blame him, it's my evil twin
{"Then I step out and see my Evil twin; he gives me an evil grin"}

[Interlude]
"Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend.
 You have slept for quite some time."

[Eminem]
So who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fuckin with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba, my album's just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3's, feel like I'm burnin to death but I'm freezin
Bed-ridden and destined never to leave the
bedroom ever again like the legend of Heath, uh
Ledger, my suicide note's barely legible, read the
bottom, it's signed by The Joker, Lorena said I never can leave her
She'll sever my wiener I ever deceive her!
Fuck that shit bitch, give up my dick for pussy
I'll be Jerry Mathers, I ever +Left It to Beaver+
Get them titties cut off, tryin to mess with a +Cleaver+
Golly Wally I vent, heat register, Jesus!
Ever since 19946 Dresden it was definitely my
destiny when on the steps, I met Deshaun
at Osborn, I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes while I wrote rhymes tryin to get props for 'em
Cause I took book smarts, and swapped for 'em
They were sleepin, I made 'em stop snorin, made 'em break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip-hop in its tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blarin through my car windows leanin on the horn
Screamin "Fuck tha Police" like COP PORN!
Flipped rap on its ear, like I dropped corn
Fuck Top 5 bitch, I'm Top 4!
And that includes Biggie and 'Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin, so who the fuck you think that third and that fourth SPOT'S FOR?
And crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him
And I'm +nuts+, then again who the fuck wants a +plain Eminem+?
But no one's insaner than Slim
Look at that {"Evil grin, evil twin"} please come in, what was your name again?!
Hi! Faggot, look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict/attic, and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney, geez, just hit me
that I should call the loony police, to come get me
Cause I'm so sick of bein the truth, I wish someone'd finally admit me
to a mental hospital with Britney
OHH! LMFAO, no way, Jo-
-se Baez couldn't beat this rap, O.J. no
Hooray, I'm off the hook
like Casey Anthony, hey hoe, HEY HO!
I sound like I'm tryin to sing the fuckin chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray"? No
I'm hollerin, you got bottom end like an 8-0-
-8, and I {"BASS"} whether we're fuckin off that instead of your face so
Let your low-end raise, yo!
Tango? What you think hoe? Slow dancin or bowling?
You tryin to hold hands with your homie?
What? You think I'm lookin for romance cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Hoe, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke, cause you don't work
Haha, but all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
as it used to be, when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him, when they tried to criticize
Cause we are the same, bitch
