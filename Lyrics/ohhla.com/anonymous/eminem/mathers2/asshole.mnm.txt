Artist: Eminem f/ Skylar Grey
Album:  The Marshall Mathers LP 2
Song:   Asshole
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Eminem]
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role think I succeeded fulfillin
But don't think I ever stopped to think that I was speakin to children
Everything was happenin so fast it was like I blinked, sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin ridiculous cause I was gettin sick of this feelin
Like I'm always under attack, man I coulda stacked my shit-list to the ceiling
Women dishin but really
thinkin if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin shit, but since when did this many
people ever give a shit what I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mention a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawin more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform, I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect, and battled for it
Mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed, atta-boy
They told me to slow down, I'd just zone out
Good luck tryin to convince a blonde, it's like tellin Gwen Stefani she sold out
Cause I was tryin to leave, +No Doubt+
in anyone's mind one day I'd go down, in history think they know now!
Because EVERYBODY knows!

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows, that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide, you are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

[Eminem]
Thanks for the support asshole
*Chka*, thanks for the support asshole

Quit actin salty, I was countin on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he roundabout dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, well goddamn honkey; that compliment's like back-handin a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him, but what the fuck's all this trash talking about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me, you knocked me down
I went down for the count, I fell but the fans caught me and now
you're gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me to take my belt, word to Pacquiao!
Momma said there ain't nothin else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out, or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion, like Freddie Roach when he's quotin
Shake-speare, so what if insults are revoltin?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled, but you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess, gotta have a goddamn
vest on your chest and a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test the testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage, rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts in all those
water bottles in Colorado, so get lost Waldo
My soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping
A black hole and I'm swallowin this track whole, better pack toilet paper
But I'm takin no crap hoe, here I go down the Bat Pole
and I'm changing back into that ol' maniac, in fact there they go
Tryin to dip out the back door retreating cause EVERYBODY knows!

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Holy mackerel, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth, I smacked a girl
off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
for thinkin we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed, "ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin magnets work?"
Cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable, hate to be dramatical
but I'm not romantical, I'm makin up words you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin a joke? It's laughable
Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault, so it's safe to say, I'm un-crackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch you just need a helmet, cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one track mind and
shorty you're fine but you sorta remind me of a 49er
Cause you've been a gold-digger since you was a miner/minor
Been tryin to, hunt me down like a dog cause you're on my ass but you can't get a scent
Cause all of my spare time's spent
on my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin
Only women that I love are my daughters, but sometimes I rhyme
and it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther
So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent, I'll never grow up
So to hell with your parents, and +mother+fuck +Father+ Time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist who +Transformed+ to an +Optimist+ in his +Prime+
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half-alive
Poured my half-empty glass in a cup, now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a motherfuckin coaster!
I'm goin back to what got me here
Yeah cocky and can't knock bein Rudolph, so fear not my dear/deer
And dry up your tear drops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
if you stare at me and see yourself, cause you're one too, shouldn't be a shock
because EVERYBODY knows (everybody knows)
