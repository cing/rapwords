Artist: Eminem f/ Liz Rodrigues
Album:  The Marshall Mathers LP 2
Song:   Survival
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Eminem] Yeah~!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This, is, survival of the fittest
This, is, do or DIIIIIE!
This, is, the winner takes it all
So take it all-oh-ohh-oh-ohh-ohhhhhh!

[Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ILL though, the skill was there!
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout bustin raps and standin for somethin, fuckin acronym
Cut the fuckin act like you're happy I'm fuckin back again
with another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of what'll
happen to them wolves, when the thought of bein thrown 
into an alligator pit I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah egos I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium ERUPT - cause

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish, I'm so close
to my goals I can almost pole vault, over the goal post (post)
And if I don't got enough in the tank maybe I can just siphon enough
to fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust!
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucker and if I don't make the cut, what, like I give a fuck
I'ma light this bitch up like I'm drivin a truck
through the side of a pump
Zero to sixty, hop in and +gun it+ like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hypin 'em UP
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a RUT
And I look like I might just give up, ehh, might've mistook
me for bowin out, I ain't takin a bow
I'm stabbin myself with a fuckin knife in the gut, while I'm wipin my BUTT!
Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin CUT!
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a NUT!
Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin the dust
It'll just, make me angrier, wait, let me remind you of what
got me this far, picture me quittin
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
It's survival of WHAT?

[Chorus]

[Liz Rodrigues]
So take it all-oh-ohh-oh-ohh-ohhhhhh!

[Eminem]
(Yeah!) So get your ideas (uhh) stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
I don't do this music shit I'll lose my SHIT!
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in the booth, I SPIT!
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin you the flow no one do
Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I QUIT!
So there's nothin for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you'd better trade your fuckin mics in for some tool-box-es!
Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So pull out your pliers and your screw-dri-vers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
Cause this is somethin that I must use to suc-ceed
And if you don't like me then FUCK you, self-esteem
must be fuckin shootin through the roof, cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bullet-proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
a-llergic to failure cause every time I come close to it I just sneeze
But I just go ah-choo, then A-CHIEVE!

[Chorus]

[Liz Rodrigues]
So take it all-oh-ohh-oh-ohh-ohhhhhh!
