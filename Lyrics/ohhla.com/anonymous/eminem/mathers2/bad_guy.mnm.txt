Artist: Eminem f/ Sarah Jaffe
Album:  The Marshall Mathers LP 2
Song:   Bad Guy
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

{*Part 1*}

[Eminem - as "Mathew"]
It's like I'm in this dirt diggin up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're - right back on it
remindin me all over again how you fuckin just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first, well looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm comin for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
the way that you turned your back on me just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over; you can just close the
chapter and go about your life like it was nothin
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin fine, well I've never recovered
But tonight, betcha that what ya
'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a, better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind's sayin "Let it go, fuck this"
Heart's sayin "I will once I bury this bitch alive, hide the shovel
and then drive off in the sunset, and"

[Chorus: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene, like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
what's bad is good, and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
Follow me, I run, I run, follow me, I run, I run
I just hate to be the bad guy

[Eminem - as "Mathew"]
And to think, I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped? Shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep gettin away with, it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, +knit+, wit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget, it
You left our family in shambles, you expect me to just get
over him? Pretend he never exis-ted?
May be gone but he's not forgotten, and don't think cause he's been out the picture
so long that I've stopped the plottin, and still ain't comin to getcha
You're wrong and that shit was rotten, and the way you played him's same shit you did to
me, cold! Have you any idea the
shit that I've gone through? Feelings I harbor, all this pent-up resentment I hold onto
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin, letters you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm comin to see you
And gee, who better to talk to than you? The cause of my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh - and

[Chorus]

[Sarah Jaffe]
Follow me, I run, I run, follow me, I run, I run

[Eminem - as "Mathew"]
I've been drivin around your side of this town
like 9 frickin hours and 45 minutes now, finally I found
your new address, park in your drive, feel like I've been waitin on this moment all of my life and
it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm duckin on the side of your house, see it's
sad it came to this point, such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek, so I sneak
vengefully and treat your bedroom window like I reach my full potential, I peaked/peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Then keep tappin the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch, man
Door handle's unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this, you don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack up a lung 
Like you picked an axe up and swung
Stick to the core plan, dragged to the back of a trunk
by one of your fans, irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back cause they SUCK!
It's just me, you and the music now Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in a car right now, wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's the sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
Well how's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now cause after this you'll be, officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Mathew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials!
I initially was, gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much I figured what the fuck, the
best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near, hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
OHH GOD, POLICE!
AHHH! Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
New plan Stan, Slim, chauvinist pig
Drove in this big Lincoln Town Car, well gotta go, almost at the bridge
Haha, big bro it's for you, Slim, this is for him
and Frank Ocean, oh hope you can +Swim Good+! Now say you hate homos AGAIN!
{*car tires squeal*} {*CRASH*}

{*Part 2, beat changes*}

[Eminem]
I also represent {*LOUD splash*}
anyone on the receivin end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still IN
I'm your karma closin in with each stroke of a PEN
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly IN
When they say all of this is approachin its END
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again!
Back's to the wall, I'm stackin up all them odds
Toilet's clogged, yeah cause I'm talkin a lot of shit but I'm backin it all up
But in my head, there's a voice in the back and it hollers
after the track is demolished, "I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringin in your ears, I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
eatin your vocal chords, after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow!
I'm the bullies you hate, that you became, with every faggot you slaughtered
comin back on ya, every woman you insult, batter
But the double-standard you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything, you take for granted
Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a façade and Mathew and Stan's just symbolic
of you not knowin what you had 'til it's gone cause
after all the glitz and the glam, no more fans that are callin
your name, cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of 'em
I'm the hindsight to say 'I told you so!' Foreshadows of all the
things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop, after they call ya, biggest laughingstock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip, the baggage you have
but, as you gather up all your possessions, if there's anything you have
left to say, 'less it makes an impact then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case, better make sure you're packin a wallop!"
So, one last time, I'm back
'fore it fades into black and it's all, over
Behold the, final chapter in the saga
Tryin to recapture that, lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started it all, tragic, portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings, tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable, here goes a wild stab in the dark
Uh, as we pick up where the last "Mathers" left off</pre>
