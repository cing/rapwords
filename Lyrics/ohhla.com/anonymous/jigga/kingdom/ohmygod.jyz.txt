Artist: Jay-Z
Album:  Kingdom Come
Song:   Oh My God
Typed by: wcbe@aol.com

You are tuned in
To the greatest
Young H-O-V
Let's go get em again Just
Oh my God

Pops sped off, left mom with a bundle of
Joy, ya boy smacked dab in the jungle
Took tunnel vision, but he would soon become a mogul
But first he brought that crack back like a yo-yo
Don't play with my yo-yo, loco niggas in the hood
First niggas hating on me, it's all good
I'm buying things like my shit don't stink, Gucci links in Gucci goose's
Watching too many movies, bulletproof this
Had some nerve, like pulling tooth'ses
When your 16, coming through roofless
Yea your boy "ruthless", like Ice Cube was
Turn the whole city on, I'm the new blood
So if this is your first time hearing this
You're about to experience someone so cold
A journey seldom seen, the American dream
From the bottom to the top of the globe they call me Hov

[Chorus]
They gunning for me, wanna see me fall
You know my story, I've been through it all
Night's I've felt like dying, but I ain't crying
What didn't kill me, made me strong as iron
Iron, iron (Oh my God, Hov)

Now I'm knee deep in the concrete
Like a street's made a quicksand, it's beyond deep
I got a "chemical romance", two left feet
So now I dance with the devil, please G-O-D
Save me from the "black parade", release me
My life like Grant Theft Auto, PSP
I'm in that Volvo, puffing on that la-la
Ducking from the po-po, everytime I drive by
Say hi to the bad guy, all my momma's friends was like
"Mmm, mmm, mmm" would you just look at him
So sorry dear momma for your embarrasment
But give me a couple years and pray I'll never sin again
Got all these rival dealers trying to do me in
And all these little rappers don't know how prepared for them I am (I am)
I'm feelin like the world's against me Lord
Call me crazy, but strangely I love the odds

[Chorus]

Now these baby ballers, toy rappers/toy wrappers
Callin out my name to bring the boy backwards
Shooting air-balls at the basket
What you call money, I pay more in taxes
I got crowned king down in Africa
Out in Niger, do you have any idea
Sold out shows out in Seoul, Korea
Jo'burg, Dublin, Tanzinia
Lunch with Mandella, dinner with Cavalli
Still got time to give water out to everybody
Everybody, fall back
Y'all rapping, I'm reenacting
CNN, you see it's accurate
ESPN, see me in action
Monday night's, when the half ends
When you 10 years in, holla back then

[Chrous]

(Good Lord, good Lord, good Lord
Good Lord, I said I feeeeeeeeeeeel like I'm dyiiiiiiiing)</pre>
