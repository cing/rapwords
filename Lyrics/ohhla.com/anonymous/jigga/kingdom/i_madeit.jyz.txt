I told you Ms. Carter... here we are

(Mama I made it)
You know how I do it like the doc do it I fly through it
That's how I operate (Mama I made it)
Ghetto like the grease when you getting ya hairbraided
Sweeter than ya Sister kool-aid is
Hooray!!  It's the underdog now my feet
On the desk I'm the Presidential favorite
Can't believe I got away with
My earliest stages to being on stages
Having my way with the world Congratulations !!
Your baby boy's a made man I'm a hold the fam down like three generations
I'm talking when spaceships are around and ya great-great grands
Reminiscing bout the foundation you gave em
For repairing my relationship with my pops before he passed
All I ask is you raise your glass in this celebration
Toast to the most beautiful girl in the world
My inspiration thanks for the information

[Chorus]
Mama I made it... Mama I made it

Out in BK where
It aint everyday that you make it out
Be on top of yachts waving
I remember you saving for the light bill paid the rent with the light bill
Now our crib dark as a basement
Had to lock up the phone when you wasn't home
We was communicating like the money you made wasn't basic
Our cable was basic no HBO WHT just Ralph Mcdames on the station
I aggravated you for Atari and Colico vision pin stripe Lee's
When the first day of school came in
I was ok with not having everything
long as Saturdays you had the commodores playing
The expression on your face was priceless
Still with me till this day baby girl I won't erase it
I go to my grave with the memory of the sacrifice you made
You deserve a standing ovation

[Chorus]

Now your lil ms. Fit make sure everyday is Christmas write out your wish list
6's wrist is glistening you don't even like jewels
But you could get missing anyway you like to
Where the waters light blue anything you order
Sign it to your nice room leave a extra tip ma be extra nice to em
Ceo of carter foundation Wow!!!
I know pop looking down I know Carlique somewhere up in the clouds like
Go get em grandma make me proud
Didn't have a man in the house so you made one
So I act like your husband and I'm only your son
I told you one day I'd get you a home
I didn't know it could possibly be in Rome
Told me don't wait on nobody get your own
So with me myself and my microphone I made it

[Chorus] </pre>
