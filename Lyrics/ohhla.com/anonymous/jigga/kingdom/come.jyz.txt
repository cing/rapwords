[Intro] (Sample courtesy of "Superfreak" by Rick James)
I don't know what life will be in H.I.P. H.O.P.
Without the boy H.O.V. (I will be, I will be)
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah)
So after this flow you might owe me a favor (Yeah)
When kingdom come, you ready? (I will be)
When kingdom come, I'm ready (I will be)
When kingdom come (Yeah, yeah) I'm ready
(Hey! Hey! Hey Hey Hey!!!)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Now everywhere I go they like HOV you back
Up out the corner office out the coldasack
Where's Iceberg Slim he was the coldest cat
Get your swag back daddy where your focus at
Got to admit a little bit I was sick of rap
But despite that the boy is back
And I'm so evolved I'm so involved
I'm showing growth, I'm so in charge
I'm C.E.O. and yeah going god
I'm so indebted, I should have been deaded
Sellin blow in the park, this I know in my heart
Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark
I been up in the office you might know him as Clark
But, just when you thought the whole world fell apart
I - take off the blazer losen up the tie
Step inside the booth Superman is alive

[Chorus: Jay-Z] (Sample courtesy of "Superfreak" by Rick James)
(I will be) The King Of New York (I will be) New York
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah)
So after this flow you might owe me a favor (Yeah)
When kingdom come, you ready? (I will be)
When kingdom come, uh huh (I will be)
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah, yeah)
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
(Hey! Hey! Hey Hey Hey!!!)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I hear "hurry up Hov" when I'm out in the public
Cause niggas like it, you love it; We be it, you're of it
You breathe it, we need it; bring it back to the hustlas
Had to dust off the Hammer, dance - can't touch this
C'mon playboys, bring the cars back out
Cause ya boy Hov is back, you know them broads comin out
Got 'em dancing on the bankhead, like they from Bankhead
Fuck Cristal, so they ask me what we drinking
I thought dudes remark was rude okay
So I moved on to Dom Cuvée Rose
And it's much bigger issues in the world, I know
But I first had to take care of the world I know
I'm from the bottom, so I still feel em from the bottom
Underdog before my cape, still couldn't stop him
Flash Gordon when recording, spark the light in the dark
Peter Park, Spiderman, all I do is climb the charts

[Chorus: Jay-Z] (Sample courtesy of "Superfreak" by Rick James)
(I will be) The King Of New York (I will be) New York
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah)
So after this flow you might owe me a favor (Yeah)
When kingdom come, you ready? (I will be)
When kingdom come, uh huh (I will be)
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah, yeah)
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
(Hey! Hey! Hey Hey Hey!!!)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Just when they thought it was all over
I put the whole world on my back and broad shoulders
The War-Hova, but who you know took over tracks like that
Guess what New York, New York - we back
And I ain't never been afraid of a drought
Since I was six, seventeen been gettin money down south
Bout it, bout it, Master P
Ask the nigga Pimp C, ask my homey Bun B
I run the streets the streets don't run we
Y'all run, we chill still waters run deep
I repeat, sing a long with me
I run the streets the streets don't run we
Ladies sayin where you been Superman?
When niggas spendin ten million in media on my hands
The Bruce Wayne of the game have no fear
When you need me just throw your ROC signs in the air, yeah!

[Chorus: Jay-Z] (Sample courtesy of "Superfreak" by Rick James)
(I will be) The King Of New York (I will be) New York
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah)
So after this flow you might owe me a favor (Yeah)
When kingdom come, you ready? (I will be)
When kingdom come, uh huh (I will be)
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah, yeah)
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
(Hey! Hey! Hey Hey Hey!!!)</pre>
