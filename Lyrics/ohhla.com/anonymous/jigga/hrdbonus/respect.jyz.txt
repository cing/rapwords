Aiyyo,

You get all bent up
Nobodys gonna hold me down
nobodys gonna slow me down
All she be like straw house, nigga and just blow me down
>From Harlem a.k.a. Bangladesh, shock 'em down
thang thang
Make it sound like shitty bang bang
You still think im gonna choke the opposite of Jay-Z and Jermaine
Except im a rebel, on another level
where money mean everything
Talk to me

No they aint ready to talk to you
Im gonna let these cats know man
Yo, listen here

I flow with fo fo guys
haten po po spies
Relay on movin home grown pies
Rather dies than to see it
mo' poties
I see my people shy
They will be knock
whoever look through that pee holes blind
Smashing everything from the game 
to that freak hoes fives
shake life
Must be crack cause it grows most wise
and losers finally quote to see a cat like me, cold shine
Every night up in the down 
just to kill mo' timers
Bout time you let me play
Got more game than EA
Used to take goldeen trips to PA
we need a
Now on the way to the top it never stop
Catch me in every block with a rock
Eatin my way and its still just cocked
ready to pop, now whos the fooler
Think im uhs cause im cuter
be the same on in the cooler with the hole in the midula
I used to take twenties and buddha, to the face
till I caught that case with George, on my waist
Now B.O.
trying to violate if I get a taste
feel me?
Im just like you
want beef, i'll bust like you
need to bust just like you, only trust my crew
Diamonds In Da Ruff

Aiyyo, whatever you all want to do yall do it, bring it man, dont talk
to me, run at me

I can see its alot of yall goons
that dont want to see me get no riches
All im gonna do is rip the shows, get the hoes, and take your bitches
Nigga, you aint gotta like me
Front, then you gotta fight me
I dont play fair
I play to win and my crew is like me
Im from Spanish Harlem
1st Ave. to be exact
11-9-9, you niggas gotta problem wit that
Know from Eastend to Riverside and Fineas Dieon
bring the war without the wip like Dieon
Im gonna see 'em
Im gonna respect something that is important to me
aint nobody you know livin' that ever extorted me
My fam i'd die for, cry for, lie for
take a knife in the eye for
Nigga, im a suvivour in the BX, rep my Lenox
to 241st and Whiteplains
smack you like a Parker brother
fathers hit your light game
and I just came in
to let yall niggas know
bout a Diamond In Da Ruff
and I still need the dough, nigga

Nigga jumps across the webs, the Wilson, Grand Jev, Metro long, Polo
grounds, Saint Knick, Manhatten and we run New York

Yall want to know my style basically
Im a thorough nigga named B. Bubblin
not that cats you want trouble with
and i demand respect
Change the Harlem Vet. from Foster, Lincoln, Whillen Projects across
110th
to the depth witty, F had the West Indies
Im odin it right so my chicken head dog can rest with me
Most cats is unworthy
and you can find me if you wanted to on 1st Ave.
In gold Tim's and Yankee jersey
