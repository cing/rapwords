Artist: Jay-Z
Album:  Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter/Blue Streak Soundtrack
Song:   Girl's Best Friend
Typed by: jan@88hiphop.com

Jigga man, Swizz Beats
History in the making, part three
Lights out ladies!

Chorus: (2x)

C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy  (to all my baby thugs)
Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
Hold me tight and call me your lady  (say it louder)
Let me scream your name

[Jay-Z]
I took ya outta Jacob's in clusters
Busters they wanted to rush us
Love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
When you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
You can light up the whole room, turning day from night
When the summertime is in and the tops are down
With you around my neck we lock the whole block down (that's right)
It took shortsleeves and loungin' to understand
The reason they call you ice, everybody freeze
Ain't a pendant in the sun who can shine like you
And that platinum in the charm who can blind like you
The direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do
I used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools
Guess I was jealous that they was so next to you
So I devoted half my time to invest in you
The other half was spent on protecting you
Cause you belong to me, now sing ya song for me
C'mon

Chorus 2x

[Jay-Z]
I'm often with you so they wonder bout the juice I got
I took you from the projects and an abusive pops
From the bottom to the top
The skateboard to the drop
From the nada to the Prada
I got ya like I got ya
From the first time I put you round my neck and locked ya
It was then I knew everywhere I went you'd follow
Soon I spent every dolla you became my habit
other brothers vice was smoke, mines was carats
The more checks I got the more I laced my crew
The rocks got bigger, watch face got blue
Tricked a little bit, shit I lace my Boo
Fuck it, my mistress I laced her too
Cop my jewels twice, like deja vu
If they ever met in the mall, it's ova ya'll
Just the way I do, and either way you win
I mean the thugs love ya when your girl's best friend

Chorus 2x

[Jay-Z]
And the wedding band you love
In the gold chain you thug
Sometimes you given just because
And the tennis bracelet means they want relations
Know that they wanna fuck the only reason they give you up
In the hands of goldiggas you never enough
Rings, things,  just never enough
With me and you together gon shine to the end
I mean the thugs love ya but ya girls best friend

Chorus til end</pre>
