"I'm not a one girl's guy... [real talk for ya, peep game]
And they know it, when it comes to love I don't lie [we don't lie man]
and the girls respect me for it [you gotta respect that]
Ain't gonna say my nose can't be open [I may never say never]
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there
to choose one from [too many ladies, ha]
I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girls out

HOOK: I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 1]
Whoo! Who you lovin, who you wanna be huggin, heh
who you wit, who you wanna be fuckin
got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
to put this in laymen's term, I gave her some knowledge
she gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college
knowin she does this homework, I give her in house tutoring
in and out I'm movin through her student body union and
she, call me professor, say daddy come and test her
so she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
I'm like, at this rate ma you never graduate
she said, I aint no fool I make it up in summer school

HOOK:
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
Now let the people sing
I'm tryin girls out, [just tryin girls out] just tryin girls out
Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 2]
Heh, who you lovin, who you wanna be fuckin
who said what, why you trippin girl, why's you fussin?
got this model slash actress slash part time waitress
spend a whole day she hangin round with part time haters
all they do is diss dirt and put a up on my latest
itinerary, but since I tend to vary see
I tend to carry, more rumors than ten Mariah Careys
tend to hurries in ten places at once
plus she can't front just peep how I run mines
ma, our time together is our time together, and uh
our time apart is our time apart
so love Jay with your mind girl and not your heart
and some day I slow down, but for now I get around
like the late Makiavelli or Perelli twenty inches
or caine and O-dog, stick up tape from menace
you tell 'em chicks if they must know my buisness

HOOK:
I'm tryin girls out, just tryin girls out
put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
holla at ya when I get off tour
I'm tryin girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 3]
I'm lookin for, southern girl that cook like Patti LaBelle
big ghetto booty, scarf over doobie
Chanell under the louie, Gucci over booty
Vicki covered titties, attitude of the city
pretty, witty, girly, whirly
one who likes to party but come home early
light kinda dark, short sorta tall
slim, kinda thick I swear I love 'em all
she can cook the coke and got hook up on the license
but she can get you first class seats for coach prices
isn't this great, my flight leaves at eight
her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds

HOOK:
I'm tryin girls out, just tryin girls out
put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
holla at ya when I get off tour
I'm tryin girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
holla at ya when I come off tour

"I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it
when it comes to love, I don't lie, and the girls respect me for it
aint gonna say my nose? can't be over,
but right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from
I'm tryin girls out, waiting patiently,
 just tryin girls out, until I find the one for me"</pre>
