[Chorus: Timbaland, Nas, Pharrell, Swizz Beatz & Justin Timberlake]
D-boy drug dealer look, billionaire
D-boy drug dealer look, billionaire nigga
From the cocoa leafs to the farmers (ooh)
To the polo fleece to the bombers (ooh)
R.I.P. to Gianni (ooh)
Now we on our way, ay (let's work!)
D-boy drug dealer look (let's work!)
Billionaire-naire-naire...
Let's work, let's work, let's work!

[Nas]
Bally shoes, Gucci sneakers
Pharrell's a pharaoh, peep the features
.. Unlaced Adidas
Top of the world like pyramids in Giza
Uhh, Fila sweats
'88, I rocked a mock neck
Carried a nine in my projects
Bucket hat, EPMD cassettes
Now I'm smokin loud in Ibiza
Mix the D'USSÉ with the reefer
My whole life is leisure
Gangsta lean like the Pisa
Eiffel Tower, Hermès towel
The Feds is perched like an owl
Real niggaz all feel the hook

[Chorus] w/ minor varations

[Jay-Z]
Lemme make sure you can hear my muh'fuckin jewelry {*chains jingling*}

What you know about goin out, head west
Maybach, 3 TV's all up in the headrest
+Ma$e+ niggaz at Madison Square Garden
20 million sold and we still catchin charges
Rope chains, Rakim and Eric B
Bought my sidekicks, Suzuki, Jeeps and Cherokees
Hoop earrings, coupes with the rear cameras
Put that bitch in a cherry M-3
I'm not your average dope dealer
Silver Toyota four runners and four wheelers
Me and Teflon Q-4-5 Infinite
Windows tinted, white girl all in it
UH! Britney bitch
MCM seats buck-50 stitch
Uh... Versace plates
Got the Basquiat collab' from Versace's place
Uh... Cuban link 5 kilo
Your life is illegal when your chain can get the RICO
Uh~! Real niggaz all feel the hook
(Let's work!)

[Chorus] - first 6 lines w/ ad libs

[Chorus] w/ minor variations
