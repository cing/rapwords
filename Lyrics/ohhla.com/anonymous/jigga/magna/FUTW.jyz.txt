[Intro: Jay-Z]
Just let me be great... let me be great!
Uhh, I feel like muh'fuckin Cassius Clay right now
Genius~!

[Jay-Z]
Don't be good my nigga, be great
After that government cheese we eatin steak
After them projects, now we on estates
I'm from the bottom, I know you can relate

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Fuck up the world!
Let's fuck up this world
Fuck up the world!
Me and destiny got a date

[Jay-Z]
Martin had a dream, Hov got a team
My chain already heavy, don't let me get a ring
Parades down Flatbush, confetti on my fur
Turn right on Red Hook, niggaz heavy on the curve
See most my niggaz died early twenties or late teens
I'm just tryin to come from under thumb of this regime
1% of a billion more than niggaz ever seen
Still they wanna act like it's an everyday thing, clean

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Fuck up this world...
Fuck up this world...
Fuck up this world!
Fuck up the, uh

[Jay-Z]
High yellow sky dweller and the rose gold
Legend of the summer in the Rose Bowl
Came through Pasadena in the low-low
Just to show respect to the cholos
Feelin like a stranger in my own land
Got me feelin like Brody in "Homeland"
I just want a shot to show my genius
Standin on the top, hold my penis
America tried to emasculate the greats
Murder Malcolm, gave Cassius the shakes
Wait, tell 'em "Rumble young man rumble"
Try to dim your lights, tell you be humble
You know I'm gon' shine like a trillion watts
You know a nigga trill as Michael Jackson's socks
Send a light out to Compton and the hundred blocks
Lil' bastard boy, baskin on top - ah

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Fuck up this world
Let's fuck up this world!
Uh, let's fuck up the world...
Let's fuck up this world...
Fuck up the, uh

[Jay-Z]
Sippin D'USSÉ, boy this ain't your daddy 'gnac
He in the Cadillac; me? I'm in the Maybach
This ain't grey sweatsuits and white tube socks
This is black leather pants and a pair of Stance
Socks is my synopsis is clear
Got stripclubs feelin like Oxford, I swear
Teacher teacher, I'm tryin to unteach ya
All the shit they taught y'all they got you all in the bleachers
When you front row at the Knicks game, those the Spike Lees
You front row everywhere, you in the H-O-V's
... Jordan 1's and dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Make a million, 'nother million, let my niggaz make a million
'til we all check a billion, shit it's just the way I'm feelin
We have yet to see a ceiling, we just top what we top
Cause the bars don't struggle and the struggle don't stop, uh

[Outro: Jay-Z]
Let's fuck up this world!
Let's fuck up this world
Let's fuck up the world!
Let's fuck up the world
It's our time now
Let's fuck up the world...
Fuck up this world!
