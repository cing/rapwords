Artist: Jay-Z
Album:  Magna Carta... Holy Grail
Song:   Nickels & Dimes
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Chorus: sample of "Nikels and Dimes" by Gonjasufi]
Nickels and dimes (nickels and dimes)
Sticks to my mind (sticks to my mind)
I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
You have my friends (you have my friends)

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, got a thing for nickel-plated nines and pretty dimes
Mac-11 I squeeze like lemon limes
Squirt, obey your thirst, fashion lines
'tween beauty and beast, I +Walk the Line+
Uh, Johnny Cash, I'm a real G
I cut myself today to see if I still bleed
... Success is so sublime
Gotta do that time to time so I don't lose my mind
Somethin 'bout the struggle so divine
This sort of love is hard to define
When you scratchin for every nickel and dime
Got me itchin to do this shit for my mom
Uh, do this shit for my town
Leave the door open hopin they kick it down
Purest form of givin is anonymous, to anonymous
We gon' make it there, I promise this

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, sometimes I feel, survivor's guilt
I gave some money to this guy, he got high as hell
Now I'm part of the problem, far as I could tell
Did I do it for him, or do it for myself?
Can't lie to myself, I love my niggaz more than my own blood
I'd die for my niggaz and I love my cub
Hope that's not fucked up
I got a problem with the hand-outs; uh, I took the man route
I'll give an opportunity though, that's the plan now
No guilt in givin, clear a nigga conscience out
No guilt in receivin, everything within reason
Can't see it takin food out my little monster's mouth
That'll drive me +Gaga+, run up in your momma's house
Uh, two nickels, one dime
Manslaughter charges, the lawyer, knocked it down
Uh, I'm just tryin to find common ground
'fore Mr. Belafonte come and chop a nigga down
Mr. Day-O, major fail
Respect these young'ins boy, it's my time now
Hublot homie, two-door homie
You don't know all the shit I do for the homies
... Nickels and dimes

[Chorus]

[Interlude: sample of "Nikels and Dimes" by Gonjasufi]
It all depends...
How the story is...
Nickels and dimes (nickels and dimes)
Tickles my mind

[Jay-Z]
Uh, pardon my hubris, uh, Stanley Kubrick
With +Eyes Wide Shut+, I could cook up two bricks
Turn nickels to dimes, turn dimes to quarters
Turn wives from daughters, oh I'm clear as water
And just for clarity, my presence is charity
My flow is a gift, philanthropist
Uh, e'rybody 'round me rich, or will be
Baby boy I promise you this, or kill me
And when a nigga go as the old adage go
You die rich or you die a disgrace so just let me grow
Uhh, watch me cook, throw no looks
like Magic in his prime when Kareem sky hooked
Yeah, y'all not +Worthy+
Sometimes I feel like, y'all don't deserve me, my flow unearthly
The greatest form of givin is anonymous, to anonymous
So here y'all go, I promise this

[Chorus] - 2X
