Artist: Jay-Z f/ Foxy Brown
Album:  Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life
Song:   Paper Chase
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Foxy Brown]
Uhh, uhh, uh-huh
Uhh (paper chase)
Bonnie n Clyde
Y'all motherfuckers know how it's goin down
(gotta get that paper y'all)
That's right, uhh
(Uh-huh uh, yeah, Roc-a-Fella, yeah
 Paper chase y'all, paper chase WHAT? Uh)

Greyhound bitch, stay down bitch
Bout to set up shop with Jay, round this bitch
Half a brick of yea, bout to lay down this bitch
(til November?)  Nah, I'm here to like slay down this bitch
What you think?  I don't wanna have to spray down this bitch
Call my whole team, from around the way down this bitch
I'm tryin to stay down this bitch, play down this bitch
Had a sound, so my nigga Jay drown the six
Roll the windows down and, weight round this bitch
But there's a couple things 'fore it's OK round this bitch
Gotta talk to the natives, let em know I'm here 
for all to get the paydays, first I line up all the haters
I got jobs for ya, drop stars for ya
More arms than Green Bay's Brett Favre for ya
Money providentials hope that's not a problem for ya
If so, Jigga be here, day after tomorrow for ya (That's right!)

Chorus: Foxy, Jay-Z

[F]	Gotta get that paper dog
[F]	Gotta touch that, love that, paper dog, uhh!
[J]	Gotta get that paper dog
[J]	Gotta have that grab that paper dog!
[F]	Gotta get that paper dog
[F]	Gotta spend that, bend that, split that, get that
[J]	Gotta get that paper dog
[J]	When I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at?

[Jay-Z]
I got my two guns, I came to scoop ones
A down ass bitch and she down to click
Got a nice little hooptie that I get around with
And my plan is, not to leave this town til I'm rich
Gotta find a nigga sellin all them ounces and shit
Tell them get down with the click or get found in a ditch
See I drop down and strip, I turn around and spit
Not to hit em, just to let em know the sound of shit
Return later that evening in the club with Fox
And I got the snub nosed for those that love to box
I'm in search of them young niggaz that hug the block
all day, til it's like gray outside
Shoot dice talkin shit all day outside
And even when it's hot, they outside
Let em know, how it's gon' go, Bonnie n Clyde
And aiyyo, you will want me on your side

Chorus

[Jay-Z]
Yo, yeah, I got that stress and I got it the best
I ain't got it to give but I got it to test
And if you wanna get down, all you gotta invest
is your time, I gotta move this in a, week or less
For the next couple of days I brought her all I posess
The Rolex, necklaces with the VVS
Twin to drive in the passenger with a TV rest
For my top draft picks I cop the new GS
Now all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team
Cause I ain't sold em a dream, I just showed em the cream
Picked em up in the afternoons and told em some things
You know the regular shit you do when you moldin them teens
Yo, never lay your head where you holdin them things
From family, to your business, nothing goes in between
Never feared no man, put four in his Beem
Drop your gun then, blow the scene, ya heard me?
