Verse One: Jay-Z

Can I hit in the MORNIN
without givin you half of my dough
And even worse if I was broke would you WANT ME?
If I couldn't get you finer things
like all of them diamond rings bitches KILL FOR
would you STILL ROLL?
If we couldn't see the sun risin off the shore of Thailand
would you RIDE THEN, if I wasn't DRIVIN?
If I wasn't ah, eight figure nigga by the name of Jigga
would you come around me or would you clown me?
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
put your two lips on my wood and kiss it - could ya
see yourself with a nigga workin harder than 9 to 5
contend with six, two jobs to survive, or
do you need a BALLA?  So you can shop and tear the MALL UP?
Brag, tell your friends what I BOUGHT YA
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo..

Chorus: repeat 2X

[Jay-Z]	Can I get a FUCK YOU
	to these bitches from all of my niggaz
	who don't love hoes, they get no dough
[Amil]	Can I get a WOOP WOOP
	to these niggaz from all of my bitches
	who don't got love for niggaz without dubs?

[Amil]	Now can you bounce wit me, uhh
[Jay-Z]	Bounce wit me, bounce wit me
	Can ya can ya can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me

[Jay-Z]	Can ya can ya can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me
[Amil]	Yeah, uh-uh uh uh

Verse Two: Amil

You ain't gotta be rich but FUCK THAT
How we gonna get around your BUS PASS
Fo' I put this pussy on your mustache
Can you AFFORD ME, my niggaz breadwinners, never corny
Ambition makes me, so horny
Not the fussin and the frontin
If you got nuttin, baby boy, you betta
"Git Up, Git Out and get somethin"  Shit!
I like a, lot of P-rada, Alize and Vodka
Late nights, candlelight, then I tear the cock up
Get it up I put it down erytime it pop up, huh
I got to snap em, let it loose, then I knock ya
Feel the juice, then I got ya, when you produce a rocka
I let you meet momma and introduce you to poppa
My, coochie remains in a Gucci name
Never test my patience nigga, I'm high maintenance
HIGH CLASS, if you ain't rollin, bypass
If you ain't holdin, I dash yo

Chorus

[Jay-Z]	Now can you bounce for me, bounce for me
[Ja]	Uhh

[Ja]	UHH!
[Jay-Z]	Gi-gi-gi-gi can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me
[Ja]	Uhh!  Yeah

Verse Three: Ja (Rule)

It ain't even a question
how my dough flows, I'm good to these bad hoes
Like my bush wet and undry like damp clothes
What y'all niggaz don't know, it's eazy, to pimp a hoe
Bitches betta have my, money fo' sho'
Before they go, runnin they mouth, promotin half
I be dickin they, back out, go 'head, let it out
I fucks with my gat out, bounce and leave a hundred
Makin em feel, slutted even if they don't want it
It's been SO LONG
since I met a chick ain't on my tips but then I'm
DEAD WRONG, when I tell em BE GONE
So HOLD ON to the feelin of flossin and platinum
cause from NOW ON, you can witness Ja the I-CON
with hoodies and TIMBS ON, cause I thugs my bitches
VeVe, studs my bitches, then we rob bitch niggaz
I'm talkin bout straight figures if you here, you wit us
If not Boo, you know what, I still fucked you

Chorus

[Jay-Z]
Now can you bounce wit me, bounce wit me
Ge-gi, ge-gi-gi-gi bounce wit me, bounce wit me
Wit me wit me wit me bounce wit me, bounce wit me
Bounce, bitch, bounce.. wit me wit me wit me wit me
Can ya bounce wit me wit me
Ge-gi, uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh
