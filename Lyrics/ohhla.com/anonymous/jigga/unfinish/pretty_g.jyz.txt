Artist: Jay-Z & R. Kelly
Album:  Unfinished Business
Song:   Pretty Girls
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Uhh, y'all know what this is
Now would be a good time to start bobbin your heads
Kels, and it, and it, uhh

[R. Kelly]
Excuse me miss, don't mean to interrupt
But you're the hottest chick in this club
The way you shake your ass to this beat
It's like your booty got dancin feet
I wanna take you home, in my Hummer Jeep
All over me while you ridin the beep beep
I just really wanna taste your ice cream
It's the weekend baby I got the {?}
Go on girl, the way you do me
This is somethin like a fantasy
You're that girl from the magazine
BET, or, MTV
So baby let me take you to my ecstasy
Pull up to the club on them 23's
Girl you've got that shit in your hip
that make me wanna spend, money

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Pretty girls (where you at)
I'm talkin to the ones, that came alone
Pretty girls (put your hands up)
The single ones, we wanna take you home - c'mon
Pretty girls... (you make me wanna shout)
Let's, go!

[Jay-Z]
Whether you tall like Lisa Leslie
Or short like the barrel on that baby 380
Pretty lady, I got a ride to fit yo' frame
From the Coupe to the big Mercedes
{?}, these groundhogs stay with the cash
And the black card don't got no max
Fall, back, blow on some Merikesh hash
With more Manolos than Sarah Jess' had
How you gon' go back to dudes with little sacks
Little kiddie chromes in they itty bitty homes
Fuckin up your lungs, puffin that homegrown
You should be with us, cuttin in Hong Kong
Straight shots of Catron or Dom Perignon
Guys your girls say Shawn very long
So if you ain't afraid of catchin a love jones
Get with Coach Dean Smith, bitch get in the zone, c'mon

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
Tell me what you're drinkin at the bar ma
I'm gonna buy ma, anybody tell you youse a star ma
You remind me of my car ma, no ignition
I start the Coupe up from the kitchen
My pretty girls get plenty attention
When it come to sex get plenty of inches
We shop, like we all broke detention
Club like we at a alcoholic's convention
Hit the 'tel with two chicks and she with it
Mama got down like the flo' when she did it
Pretty girls, keep shakin ass now mama
This party is not over

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
What's your name, what city you represent ma
Where the hands on all the pretty girls ma
For the players and the hustlers in the club now
And all my niggaz that be sippin pimp juice now

[Chorus]</pre>
