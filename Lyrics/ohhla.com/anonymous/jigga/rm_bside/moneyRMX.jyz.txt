Verse One, Jay-Z: 

To the top wit my niggas 
Pop wit my niggas 
Drive by in whips, rock rocks wit my niggas 
Break day on the hottest block wit my niggas 
Just cause I (DMX)love my niggas (uh huh) 
Chill wit the crew (uh huh) 
Real wit the crew 
4 million sold, look- still wit the crew 
Break bread wit the fam 
Till I'm dead wit the fam 
Duck cops.  Shake feds wit the fam 
Flip them pies wit my hustlas (uh huh) 
Ride for my hustlas 
Die for my, lie for my, cry for my hustlas 
Roll wit my duns (uh huh) 
Cold wit the guns (uh huh) 
If he slow wit my ones hit the floor when I come 
I fuck wit them hoes that fuck wit them clothes 
That's real wit them shoes, keep it real wit they dudes 
I'm sick wit the flow and this is all I know
More money, more cash, more hoes BEYACHHHH!!!!!!

Chorus, Jay-Z (DMX): 2x's 

More money, more cash, more hoes (what) 
More money, more cash, more hoes (uh) 
More money, more cash, more hoes (come on) 
More money, more cash, more hoes (what, what, what) 

Verse Two, Memphis Bleek: 

Ay yo, M-E-M-P-H-I-S  Bleek 
No need to dress warm, I brought plenty of heat 
Y'all can't do nothing with this here 
For one, I pack three 9s like the year 
Y'all funny money hustlas 
7 gram hustlas 
Type to bust a O down wit ya man hustlas 
I hold bank dough, dough 6-5-4 
While you ho talk that, look for a walk dough 
Petty crime niggas 
Petty time niggas 
Sold petty drugs came up wit petty thugs 
Now you got game in you 
Wanna be a menace and you got Kane in you 
I'll put them thangs in you 
I'm a hot lil' nigga 
I ain't gotta tell niggas 
You came too deep, one fell niggas 
I'm layin in the cut but still don't give a fuck 
Roc-a-fella forever, Memph man, what what 

Chorus 2x's 

Verse Three, Beanie Seigel: 

Peep the kid from P-H-I-L-L-Y 
North west south west south side 
Spit it for them bitches and niggas who stay fly 
B-Mack, Roc-a-fella till I die 
Met Jay, dropped on a album in a week 
Without unsigned hype or battle of the beats 
The first time niggas heard me spit it in the streets 
I gave y'all a thousand bars wit Memphis Bleek 
Stay strapped, heat in the car under the seat 
6 hammers even though we only 3 deep 
We clap up niggas 
Smack up niggas 
Duck tape, rope, and wrap up niggas 
Think shit a joke, go head crack up niggas 
Get treated like Coke and get capped up niggas 
The only thing funny 
Is y'all never seen big face money 
Till them big face 20s 

Chorus 2x's 

Jay-Z Talking:
