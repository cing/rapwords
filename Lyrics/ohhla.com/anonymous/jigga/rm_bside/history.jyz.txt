Artist: Jay-Z
Album:  History (Single) *
Song:   History
Typed by: michael_w515@hotmail.com 

* cut from retail release of "The Blueprint 3"

[Chorus] (Jay-Z)
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighta)
And the battle's finally won (gimme a lighta)
Victory is finally ours (lightas up)
(lightas up) History so long so long
so long, so long

In search of victory, she keeps saluting me
If only we can be together momentarily
We can make love, and make history
Why won't you visit me, until she visit me
I'll be stuck with her sister, her name is defeat
She gives me agony, so much agony
She brings me so much pain, so much misery
Like missing your last shot, and falling to your knees
As the crowd screams, for the other team
I practiced so hard for this moment victory don't leave
I know what this means, I'm stuck in this routine
Whole new different day, the same old thing
All I got is dreams, nobody else can see
Nobody else believes, nobody else but me
Where are you victory, I need you desperately
Not just for the moment, to make history

[Chorus] (Jay-Z)
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighta)
And the battle's finally won (lightas)
Victory is finally ours (yeah)
History so long so long (yeah)
(yeah) So long, so long

So now I'm flirting with death 
Hustling like a G while victory wasn't watching took chances repeatedly
As a teenage boy, before acne, before I got proactive I couldn't face she
I just threw on my hoody, and headed to the street
I swear I met success we lived together shortly
Now success was like lust, she's good to the touch
She's good for the moment but she's never enough
Everybodys had her, she’s nothing like V
But success is all I got, unfortunately
But I'm burning down the block, hoping in and out of V
But something tells me, there is much more to see
Before I get killed, cause I can't get robbed
So before me, success and death ménage
I gotta get lost, I gotta find V
We gotta be together, to make history

[Chorus] (Jay-Z)
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter sup)
And the battle finally won (lighter up)
Victory is finally ours (lighters up)
History so long so long
So long, so long

Now victory is mine, taste so sweet
She's my trophy wife, your coming with me
We'll have a baby, who stutters repeatedly
We'll name him history, he'll repeat after me
He's my legacy, son of my hard work
Future of my past, that'll explain who I'll be
Rank me amongst the greats, either one two or three
If I ain't number one, then I've failed you victory
Ain't in it for the fame, that dies within weeks
Ain't in it for the money, can take it when you leave
I want to be remembered, long after you breathe
Long after I'm gone, long after I breathe
I leave all I am, in the hands of history
That's my last will, testimony
This is much more than a song, It's a baby shower 
I've been waiting for this hour, history of ours

[Chorus x2]
Now that all the smoke is gone
And the battle's finally won 
Victory is finally ours
History so long so long
so long, so long</pre>
