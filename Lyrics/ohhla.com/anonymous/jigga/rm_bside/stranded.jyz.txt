Artist: Jay-Z f/ Rihanna
Album:  Hope For Haiti Now (Compilation)
Song:   Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Jay-Z - Chorus]
When the sky falls and the Earth quakes
We gon put this back together
We won't break
[repeat]

[Jay-Z]
Sa Pa Sé, my Port-Au-Princes
My Haitian Gods and all of my Princesses
Our condolences as you fightin' against this
We're right by your side as we tryin' to make sense of this
Heavenly father help us see through these problems
And for those that left, accept them into your garden
So here's my theory, the country's already starvin'
So we sacrificed many to shed light on all of them
God please pardon, I speak from the heart
It's the only way I see this tragedy befall on them
So lets get involved with them, hand to hand with them
Arm to arm with them til' they get strong again,
When the sky falls...

[Rihanna - Chorus]
Can't wait until tomorrow
Haiti, Mon Amour
Haiti, Mon Amour
Not gonna leave you stranded, alone, alone
oh no

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Learn from the past, New Orleans was flooded
So we know we just can't rely on the government
We under the rubble again, here we go rumbling when
When we gon catch a break, my friend lost his mother and then
And then, Carline lost her uncles and them
Buried with no caskets, they just put covers on them
And the tears fall, and we fight back
Story ain't done, it can't end like that
Nah not like this, tomorrow's survivors gonna carry on your name
You live on inside us, your memory's alive with us
You inspired us, to rebuild this country, you just guide us

[Chorus]

[not Jay-Z]
It's not the angels that are on their way
It's not the bells of Santa Trinite
The people waiting, positions vacant
For hands to help, not just to pray

[Chorus]

[French singing]
Haïti va s'élever
Tu vas te relever
Nous nous éléverons
Ensemble ensemble ensemble

(not gonna leave you stranded...)

[Jay-Z]
We gon put this back together we won't break
We gon put this back together we won't break
We gon put this back together we won't break
We gon put this back together we won't break</pre>
