[Intro: Jay Z] 
Clap for a nigga with his rappin ass 
Blow a stack for yo' niggaz with yo' trappin ass 
Clap for a nigga with his rappin ass 
Blow a stack for yo' niggaz with yo' trappin ass 
... Tom Ford {*3X*} 
 
[Jay Z] 
Comin up, comin down 
Ride clean, fix your hair in my Crown 
Bad bitch, H-Town 
Keep it trill, y'all know y'all can't fuck around 
 
Paris where we been, pard' my Parisian 
It's Hov time in no time, it's fuck all y'all season 
Piss Bordeauxs and Burgundies, flush out a Riesling 
When Hov's out them hoes out, y'all put y'all weaves in 
And - clap for a nigga with his rappin ass 
Blow a stack for yo' niggaz with yo' trappin ass 
Spent all my euros on tuxes and weird clothes 
I party with weirdoes, yeah Hov, yeah Hov 
 
[Chorus: Jay Z] 
I don't pop molly, I rock Tom Ford 
International, bring back the Concorde 
Numbers don't lie, check the scoreboard 
... Tom Ford {*5X*} 
 
[Jay Z] 
Yeah, hands down got the best flow, sound I'm so special 
Sound boy burial, this my Wayne Perry flow 
Y'all know nothin 'bout Wayne Perry though 
District of Columbia, guns on your Tumblrs 
Fuck hashtags and retweets (nigga)

Pardon my laughin, y'all only flaggin on beats (nigga) 
Pardon my laughin, I happen to think you sweet, heh

Just 'cause you born in Port Arthur don't make a nigga trill (TRILL)
Y'all here lettin that bitch run you
Need to put that hoe in check, that's what real nigga do (do!)
A bitch pussy ain't shit to me
