Album:  American Gangster
Song:   American Dreamin'
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[samples of "Soon I'll Be Loving You Again" by Marvin Gaye]
Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn, and
I thought you were here with me
If youuuuu could only see
How much I love you
That's all, that's all baby

[repeat 3X in background]
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way

[samples]
I never, felt that before
I never, felt that before
I never, felt that before
But there's always; that's all, that's all baby

[Jay-Z]
This is the shit you dream about with the homie steamin out
Back-to-back, backin them Beemers out
Seems as our, plans to get a grand
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Big dreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playin this Marvin
Mama forgive me, should be thinkin 'bout Harvard
But that's too far away, niggaz are starvin
Ain't nuttin wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target
I got, dreams of baggin sni-dow, the size of pil-lows
I see pies everytime my eyes cli-dose
I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those
Life's a bitch, I hope to not make her a widow

[repeat 3X in background]
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way

[Chorus: samples] + (Jay-Z)
I never, felt that before (American dreamin)
I never, felt that before (Just American dreamin)
I never, felt that before (American dreamin)
But there's always; that's all, that's all

[Jay-Z]
Uh, uhhhh~!
Now see the life's right there, and it seems right there
It's not quite near, and it's not like we're
professionals, movin the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah! Got a connect? No
Who in the F knows how to be successful
Need a "Personal Jesus," I'm in Depeche Mode
They say its celestial, its all in the stars
Like Tony LaRussa on how you play your Cards
Cause y'all ain't fuckin with me! The ironies are
At all costs bet on before he was boss
Now let's start, on your mark
Get set, let's go, get out the car
Goin in circles it's a vicious cycle
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
Wake up Muttley, you're dreamin again
Your own reality show, the season begins

[repeat 3X in background]
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Step one in this process, scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince 'em that you're not from the precinct
Please speak slow cause he no speaky no english
If he takes a likin after a couple of trips
and your money is straight, he's gon' give you consignment
You're now in a game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well - hold up
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am I? I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs when the jackers is schemin
And the cops is comin, you could read they mind
You could see from behind, you could redefine
the game as we know it, one dream at a time
I'm American dreamin

[repeat 3X in background]
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
American dreamin
