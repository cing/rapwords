Oh yeah, uh oh
Y'all know who it is (he's back)

If you with me, throw the diamond up one time
Ladies, if you with me, just grind to the bass line
Niggas, don't be scared to grab her from behind
And make her show out her wild side, stick out her backside

Now what the fuck they gon' do with me
Got money, got broads, got a crew with me
Real as banana clips, I got a Sue with me
Get down or lay down nigga to shoot with me
Now how the fuck they gon' deal with me
I ain't going nowhere, they gotta deal with me
Got the whole BK ready to kill with me
You scared motherfucker, keep it real with me, keep it real with me
Now what the fuck they gon say to me
Got to clap, yi mean all day with me, CLAP, yi mean
Don't play with me, CLAP, yi mean
Stay with me, don't lose me y'all
And please don't confuse me with dog, I'm different
I bought it back for a living
33 O's on a bitch back like Pippen
3 She can keep for herself and distribute
36 O's and a ki, you do the addition
Before Mitchell and Ness did it
I was moving birds like a Oriole fitted
I'm Cal Ripken Jr. let's get it

[Chorus]

Hon' what they gon' say to you
Got your hair did and your favorite shoes
Tell'em don't play with you, get'em away from you
You need a baller like I, call'em like I
See'em like naaaa
Move over y'all amateurs
No, you not balling that's Pro-Am shit
Oh, stop calling that's hoe-man shit
Stop falling asleep that's old man shit
I stands up in it like a champ up in it
Be up in it so long, get my calls transferred in it
No more minute man in it
Get my Soundscan, BDS, and Market and Glance in it

[Chorus]

What they gon do'
You got starch in your flow
I flow too many ways, got a arch in my flow
All sorts of flow, Rembrandt, Rilkey
I am art with the flow
Even if I'm filthy, you gotta pardon the flow
Niggas taking it lightly, had to darken the flow
Way I put it together, tear'em apart with the flow
I'm too smart with the flow, you just started the flow
Stop it youngin, you 106th & Park with the flow
I am pro, as you see I'm off the charts with the flow
Actually I'm number one on the charts with the flow
In some places they say this, I am God with the flow
Like my office, but they're biased, too involved with the flow
(Oh no) I am the youth spirit, I am y'all with the flow
Troubled man, dare I say, I am Mar with the flow
I come up hard but I evolve with the flow
Crossover, slam dunk, Rucker Park with the flow

[Chorus]</pre>
