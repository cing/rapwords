Artist: Jay-Z f/ Faith Evans, Notorious B.I.G.
Album:  The Blueprint 2: The Gift & the Curse
Song:   A Dream
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Jay-Z] It was all a dream
{*scratched simultaneously: "It was all a dream" - B.I.G.*}

[Faith Evans] + (Jay-Z)
Last night I had a dream
Thoughts was racin through my head (it was all a dream)
Felt so real to me
This is what was said..

[Jay-Z]
Had a dream I said, bout who he said?
Bout B.I.G. I said, that's big he said
Dig what he said, proceed he said
Indeed I said, so - breathe I did
Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothin
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes I re-peated what was said
It came to me like a .. well last evenin I said
"You feel playboy," was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?
"More money, more problems, better believe it," he said
"Careful what you wish for you might receive it," he said
I see I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said, "Hov' remind yourself
nobody built like you, you designed yourself"
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before
"Just keep doin your thing," he said, say no more

[Faith Evans]
Was it all a dream - tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
I gotta know {*"It was all a dream"*}
Was it all a dream - was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam

[Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, "Rap Attack," Mr. Magic, Marley Marl 
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin weed and bamboo, sippin on private stock 
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
with the hat to match 
Remember Rappin' Duke? "Duh-ha, duh-ha"
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the {**"World Trade"**}
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
Uhh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Faith Evans]
Was it all a dream - tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
I gotta know {*"It was all a dream"*}
Was it all a dream - was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam

{*"It was all a dream"*}
{*"It was all.."*}
{*"It was all.. a dream"*}
{*"It was all a dream"*}
{*"It was all.. a dream"*}
{*"It was all.."*}
{*"It was all.. a dream"*}

[the beat drops out and Jay-Z raps the next part acapella]

[Jay-Z]
I see I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said, "Hov' remind yourself
nobody built like you, you designed yourself"
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before
"Just keep doin your thing," he said, say no more</pre>
