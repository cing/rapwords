Artist: Jay-Z
Album:  The Blueprint 2: The Gift & the Curse
Song:   Some People Hate
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[unknown singing]
That old fashioned word.. it's a word called LOVE!
Called looooove, called looo-oooo-oooo-oooo-oooo-ove

[Jay-Z]
Oh!  This must be the way the nigga 'Pac felt when he made
"Me Against the World," "All Eyez on Me"
Y'all niggaz got me feelin like all eyes on me, me against the world
Mmm, y'all got me on my shit
Thought niggaz would appreciate what I did to this game
Bein that, I'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood
Come from the same hood you come from
We share basically the same stories
Thought niggaz would appreciate what I came and did
since ninety-six, every year
Somethin must be seriously wrong with the world
I know y'all ain't hatin

(Some people hate!) Don't tell me niggaz is hatin
(Some people hate!) Nah.. you know what I think?
(Some people hate!) I think..
(I think they've lost their minds) Think y'all lost your mind
Y'all got me on my shit

Raw rough and rugged, when addressin the mass public
My attitude is fuck it cause motherfuckers love it
Got a, chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget in Vegas
And fuck bein famous, I came to get the butters
I came from the gutter, my success in this game
is sort of like "Pro-jectic Justice," a payment for brushes
with police officers, a peace offering
From the Gods for the streets I was tossed in
'Til I'm deceased in a coffin
I'ma be a beast on these beats, releasin early and often
Please, your disdain for the brothers ain't gon' change the numbers
It's the strengthenin of chain among us
Please, we ain't afraid of none of yas, who want it with us?
Ain't nuttin changed since the ninety-six summers, c'mon

(Some people hate!) Jeah, uh, yeah
(Some people hate!) Uh, uhh, uhh
(Some people hate!) Yeah.. you know what I think?
(I think they've lost their minds) They say success breeds envy

I guess it's just the penalty of leadership
I guess I'm what niggaz wanna be and shit
Or niggaz just bored, wanna be in shit
'Fore they get to rappin, start believin it
Think they Ali and shit
I roll with the punches so I survive
I bob and weave, move my feet from side to side
I'm back, stronger than ever, surprise surprise
They try to take me out the game, but I's alive
It's like a old negro spiritual, but I mastered Tobey
With a splash of Monster Kody, shoot faster than Kobe, nigga
You bastards know me, the one and only
Big homey from the Roc, I think you pastors lonely
You need Jesus in your life.. it's either that
or y'all gon' make me put the double Desert Eagles in your life, nigga!

(Some people hate!) I know niggaz are hatin man, let me find out
(Some people hate!)
Jealousy's a weak emotion, y'all gotta overcome that man
(Some people kill their brothers)
C'mon man be stronger than that.. you know what I think?
(I think they've lost their minds) You'll be aight though

Au contraire nigga, I am here cause I earned the shit
By ridin out, when niggaz had learner's permit
We bring the knives out, or we let them burners spit
I bring them pies out if niggaz wanna burn the strip
Bring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out, turn your 6
I laid back in the Maebach
Nigga this the payback, I know you bitch niggaz from way back
Niggaz wanna clown but the pound it don't play dat
Get yourself found, drowned, where the lake at
Run up on 'em +Notoriously+, "Take that!" (take that)
And then we comin where your wake at
Eight maniac cats strapped with gats, you can hate that
Face facts, fake rap cats
can't take back what I took back to the Brook', look

(Some people hate!)
(Some people hate!)
(Some people kill their brothers)
(I think they've lost their minds)
(And I'm hung up.. ohh..)</pre>
