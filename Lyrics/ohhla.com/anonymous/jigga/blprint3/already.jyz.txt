Artist: Jay-Z f/ Kid Cudi
Album:  The Blueprint 3
Song:   Already Home
Typed by: Cedmaster3K

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Yeezy, Hova, yessir
Yeezy, Hova, uh-huh, uh-huh, hey
(You either love me or leave me alone, you either love me or leave me alone)
Jay-Z, Jay-Z, Hova, Hova.. c'mon
(You either love me or leave me alone, you either love me or leave me alone)

[Chorus One: Kid Cudi] + (Jay-Z)
Ohh, they want me to fall (fall)
Fall from the top (top) they want me to drop (drop)
They want me to stop (stop) they want me to go (go)
I'm already gone (already) the shit that I'm on (hey)
I'm already hooome (hey, I'm already home)
(Hey, I'm already home; hey, I'm already home)

[Jay-Z]
Now one more 'gain...

[Chorus Two: Kid Cudi] + (Jay-Z)
Ohh, they want me to fall (fall)
Fall from the top (top) they want me to drop (drop)
They want me to stop (no) they want me to go (no)
I'm already gone (gone) the shit that I'm on (already)
I'm already hooome (hey, I'm already home)
(Hey, I'm already home; hey, I'm already home)

[Jay-Z]
These niggas want me to go, don't they know that I'm gone?
They know I'm space shuttle level, they need oxyg-g-g-g-gene
Don't they know that they borin'? Don't they know that I yawn?
Only time they excitin' is when they mentionin' Shawn
Seen "Single White Female" when she dyed her hair blonde?
Sometimes I look at these rappers, the movie remind me of them
Somebody turn these boys off.. don't they know that I'm on?
Can't they see that it's foolish to try and kill me with songs?
What the fuck are they Lauryn? You +Killing Me Softly+
You talk me to death, only thing you can do to him
I open the door for them, what else can I do
These niggas want me to walk for them, somebody talk to them before I go off on them

[Chorus One]

[Jay-Z]
I taught 'em 'bout fishscale, they want me to fish for them
They want me to catch clean then cook up a dish for them
All of this just for them or they got a diss for him
They want me to disappear like it's gon' shift for them
They say that I'm in the way, they want me to sit for them
But what they admittin' is they ain't got shit for him
And really the fact is, we not in the same bracket
Not in the same league, don't shoot at the same baskets
Don't pay the same taxes, hang with the same bitches
So how am I in the way? What is it I'm missin'?
Nigga I been missin', nigga I been gone
The shit that you just witnessin' - I been on
And as for the critics, tell me I don't get it
Everybody can tell you how to do it, they never did it
Now these niggas is mad, oh, they call me a Camel
But I mastered the drought, what the fuck I'm an animal?
Half man half mammal, my sign is a Sadge
This is just what I planned to do - ohh, don't be mad

[Chorus One]

[Jay-Z]
Yeah, ye-yeah..
I'm in The Hall already, on the wall already
I'm a work of art, I'm a Warhol already
On another level, on another plane already
H-O-V, I got my own lane already (already)
I done cooked up the rock already
So why the fuck can't y'all get hot already? (Already)
Put your name in the pot already
Niggas compare me to Biggie and Pac (already)
... Like I'm gone already
And I am nigga I'm already home already (already)
... If y'all can't already see
I ain't worried about y'all cause I'm already me (already)
... Do you already
Enough with the complainin', boo-hoo's already
... Eat food already 
Ain't nothing given you gotta claim your shoes already

Yeah, so in summation I don't know who you racin'
I'm already at the finish line with the flag wavin' - c'mon!

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]</pre>
