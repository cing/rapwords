Artist: Jay-Z f/ Drake, Timbaland
Album:  The Blueprint 3
Song:   Off That
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro: Jay-Z] + (Timbaland)
Welcome (welcome)
To the (to the) future, uhh (Blue-print, 3, ay-ay, oh, hey-hey)
Hey, count me in (Blue-print, 3, ay, hey, hey-hey)
Find me a nice soft place to land (I got you Hov', ay ay-ay)
I'm so high (yeah, hey hey, hey, hey, c'mon)
Find me a place to land
(Fricky-fricky uhh, ahhhhh, c'mon now, c'mon now)
Yeah, right there, yeah (fricky-fricky Hov')

[Jay-Z]
I'm so tomorrow the Audemar says yesterday
Which means you on time than late
So even if I slow it dowwwwwn
My sound is fast forward – hold up
I'm just a runway show
But I wear that so my plane need my runway clothes
Hehe, Cashmere sweats
They come out next year but these my last year's sweats
And my hoe's so sick
Your new chick can't fuck with my old bitch
And you know this shit
I'm professional, they know this is
I just may let you borrow this
This the Blueprint, nigga follow this
This what what tomorrow is
Welcome to tomorrow BIIIIIIIIIII..

[Chorus: Drake] + (Jay-Z)
Whatever you about to discover we off that
You about to tell her you love her we off that
Always wanna fight in the club and we off that
But you can't bring the future back, back
Y'all are steady chasin the fame and we off that
Oversized clothes and chains we off that
Niggaz still makin it rain and we off that
Cause you can't bring the future back, back
Tell them haters get off me, the Cris' we off that
Timb's we off that, rims we off that
(Yeah we off that, is you still on that?)
(And we still makin money cause we still on that)

[Jay-Z]
This ain't black vs. white, my nigga we off that
Please tell Bill O'Reilly to fall back
Tell Rush Limbaugh to get off my balls
It's 2010, not 1864
Uhh, yeah we come so far
So I drive around town, hard top and that's all
Uhh, in my TriBeCa loft
With my high brown ahh, and my high yellow broad
Uhh, and my dark-skinned sis
In my best white mink, say what's up to Chris
Uhh, how's that for a mix?
Got a black president, got green presidents
"Blueprint's" in my white iPod
Black diamonds in my Jesús piece, my God
Uhh, we ain't trippin off that
This a Benetton hat, nigga been up off that, uhh

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
I don't give a fidduck abiddout the riddate
you used to move, what you used to do
And I don't give a fidduck abiddout the bitches
that you used to screw, what your future do
And we don't really care what you used to say
Unless that affects your future pay
I'm on a practice field runnin Two-A-Days
So I don't drop the ball when it's threw my way
So I don't give a fidduck abiddout the shit
that you probably did, who you probably is
The only time I deal in past tense
Cause I'm past rims, and I'm past tints
If you drivin it, I drove it
You got it, cause I sold it
You copped it, I bought it back
And we don't give a fidduck, nigga we off that

[Chorus]

[Outro: Timbaland]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey...</pre>
