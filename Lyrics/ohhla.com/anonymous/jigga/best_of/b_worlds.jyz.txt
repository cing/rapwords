Kel..

[R] Best of.. both worlds
[J] Stop playin with these niggaz, talk to 'em!

[R. Kelly]
This is for my niggaz down bottom and them hustlers on twenty-two's
Single parent mothers in the hood is who I'm talkin to
I know it's rough in the ghetto but let me walk witchu
Talk witchu, uh-huh, yeah-hea
And for the ones who put you down and said you wouldn't make it
But you still held your ground and came up out that basement
In the memory of those that we lost, it's deicated
We miss y'all, uh-huh, yeah-hea

[Jay-Z] + (R. Kelly)
This right here this whole album's..
in the memory of all our fallen soldiers (uh-huh)
we lost along the way (ohhhhhoooh) knahmsayin, ghetto to ghetto
City to city, worldwide, we got y'all, y'knahmean?
(Ghetto America) This album right here represents strength
(Ohhhh! Yeahhh) Strength in our people, understand it

[Both]
Cock-suckers can not touch us, the block love us
We got the ghetto on our back muh'fuckers

[R] The best of..
[J] Yeah, right
[R] both worlds (rock for 'em Hov')

[Jay-Z]
We got this locked for two reasons: we from the hood
plus we promised both our mommas that we would
Kel - take 'em to church

[R] The best of.. both worlds - ohhhhHHH!

[Jay-Z]
We mastered this, don't you know
I eat +Ether+ and breathe acid, weak bastards
We copped and we crash it
Then we cop again cause we are classic
Let me speak for ya R we "Scarface" re-enacted
"The Godfather" trilogy re-casted
But it's real like we grievin for Aaliyah with the masses
But I hope my boy Dash get to see it when he passes
I feel her soul when the Lee passes
When the wind blows, it's almost like I see her in the Hamptons
Even more reason to be up in them mansions
Laid back, feet up in the hammock, I'ma live for ya
Big too, 'til they put me in the grave
I'ma floss 'til they toss me a Bed-Stuy parade
'Til Chi-Town make a nigga Mayor for a day
In the memory of Joanne Kelly, let us pray

[R] Both worlds... welcome to the best of both worlds</pre>
