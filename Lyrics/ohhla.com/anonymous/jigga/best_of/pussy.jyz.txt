Artist: Jay-Z & R. Kelly f/ Devin the Dude
Album:  The Best of Both Worlds
Song:   Pussy
Typed by: eddie014@hotmail.com

[Devin the Dude]
Pussy is a whole different aspect of life
Wars don' started from country to country, over they women
Pussy, is one of the most powerful thangs in the world
And a lot of people don't understand how powerful pussy is
Pussy make niggas, blow they brains out, they bitch brains out
Uh, uh, pussy make people do thangs they never would think they'd do

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the p-u-s-s-y, let's have some fun
S-s-y, that's why niggas get they hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, he cop the best ride
For the power of the p-u-s-s-y

[Jay-Z]
I know this girl we call her Sweet Cooch Brown
Hands down, mami had the bombest pussy in town
One dip in the girl pool, that's all it took
One sample of the snapple, and ya ass was whupped
Have you buyin' Gucci sandals, matchin' pocket books
Blowin' up her beeper ringin' her phone off the hook
Ball players they spit money, rappers they spit time
All a while they both clamin' that they never spent a dime
Business guys, she would victimize
Have 'em paying rent on condos in the Miami high rise
We ask her, who pussy is this look her right in her eyes
She said this pussy's yours daddy, tell 'em nothin' but lies
They didn't believe it, but they wanted to, needed to
She had the type of body, that you didn't want leavin' you
So they ignored all her flirtin' ways
And put a ring on her finger I'm like, Earth to Dave

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, that gotta have the best ride
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why niggas get they hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the p-u, I see you

[R. Kelly]
I ain't no rapper, but I'ma say my shit
When it comes down to that motherfuckin' clit, clit, clit
Niggas are sick, sick, sick, turn on you quick, quick, quick
That's why I be givin' mami much, dick, dick, dick
Why chumps be coppin' them furs, and all that
Feining for this pussy, as if y'all was on crack
When it comes to the truth, I can't hold back
Y'all cats that be babysittin', and these broads need to be smacked
It's this nigga named Monroe, that I know from way back
He hit the lotto bought his girl a Cadillac
Now this bitch be creepin' behind this niggas back
He busted her guess what, he still took the bitch back
3 things niggas love, money, pussy, and drugs
Can't get one without the other 'less you soft and in love
Now take it from a player whose done all the above
Niggas it's the lesbian, R&B thug

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, that gotta have the best ride
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why niggas get they hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the p-u, I see you

[R. Kelly]
Niggas would do anything
For some pussy, hey, hey, hey, oh
See it don't matter who you are
Where ya from, in this life
At some point, you're gonna wanna
Get you some, yes you will, oooo, uuuh</pre>
