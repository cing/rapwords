* Jay-Z lyrics from OHHLA.com originally

[Mike Shinoda]
This is fun

Ladies and gentlemen let's put our hands together for the astonishing

[Mike Shinoda]
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 8th wonder of the world
The flow of the century.. always timeless.. HOV'!
Thank you for comin out tonight
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with us
We appreciate that

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Uh, H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was hurtin 'em in the home of the Terrapins; got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed, it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof -- vamoose, son of a bitch!

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
  H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
  H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem get'cha damn hands up
  H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty y'all got to feel me
  H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda (with Chester Bennington)]
Check it out, yo
(It starts with one)
One thing, I don’t know why
It doesn’t even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, (All I know)
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away and (It’s so unreal)
I didn’t look out below
I watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, and didn’t even know
I wasted it all just to (Watch you go)
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried, so

*Scratches*
1 - H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
2 - LP, Jay-Z, help me up
3 - Oh they havin good old time out there
4 - It starts with
5 - Ye-Ye-Yes!
6 - The ladies and gentleman

1, 2, 3, 4
