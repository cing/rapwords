* first single; send corrections to the typist

[Intro: Linkin Park & Jay-Z]
Yeah, Thank you thank you thank you, you're far to kind!
Whoo! Aha, uh, whoo, yeah! ready? whoo!
Whoo, Whoo

[Chorus - Jay-Z]
Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
uh uh uh uh

[Chester from Linkin Park]
Now what the hell are you waitin forrrr!!!

[Jay-Z]
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, make some noise

get 'em jay

[Verse One]
Who you know fresher than Hov'?  Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the -- you expect?  Yep, yep
Grand openin, grand closin
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him
with cheap imitations for THESE GENERATIONS!

[Chorus - Jay-Z]
Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar


[Chester from Linkin Park]
Now what the hell are you waitin forrrr!!!

[Jay-Z]
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, make some noise

[Chester from Linkin Park]
What the hell are you waitin forrrr!!!

[Verse Two]
{*sighs*} Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
to be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5
It ain't to play games witchu
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So muh-- if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore

[Verse 3]
Tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure, of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertoe, just caught in the undertoe
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertoe, just caught in the undertoe
And every second I waste is more than I can taaaakkee!!

[Chorus 2]
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've, become so nuuuuummmbbb!
(Can I get a encore? Do you want more, more, more, more)
I've, become so nuuuummmmbb!
(So for one last time I need y'all to roar!
 One last time I need y'all to roar!)</pre>
