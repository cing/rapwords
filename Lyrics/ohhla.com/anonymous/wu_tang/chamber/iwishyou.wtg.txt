Artist: Wu-Tang Clan (Ghostface Killah) f/ Tre Williams
Album:  Wu-Tang Chamber Music
Song:   I Wish You Were Here
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Ghostface Killah]
This was my favorite girl for years, she knows the way I perform
Sometimes I pull my boxers down, ya'll, with one Timb on
It be times, you know I stay away when her friends on
For some reason, she be really hot, when her friends gone
That's when I slide on over with a Guinness on the stouffer
To talk a little shit, then get a little closer
Like, what up boo, you know that Ghost loves you
I get butterflies when we hug and kiss, do you?
Huh? Answer me, let me if it's the truth now
That pretty mole above your lips looking cute now
Ooh child, I'm patient, my mind's telling me
To stay calm, I wanna get it off like a G bomb
On top of your skin, I'm sliding it in
When I'm done, you can wake it up and ride it again
Then we can hold on through the night, fan on and covers on
It's bright from the TV light, peace, good night

[Tre Williams]
Looking out my window, sun shining bright
Birds are singing, trying to make things right
Now I got music, oh, on my radio
And I can hear love songs playing, behind closed doors
Now I don't want no one, on the catch me side
But ever since you left, said goodbye

[Chorus: Tre Williams]
I wish you were here with me
I said I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here, with me

[Tre Williams]
And thinking bout your kiss, gloom all around me
Seen our love, is never gonna find me
And I keep looking, oh, for that brighter day
When all I see is, time slipping away
Oh and I got to talk, to keep myself together
But all I see is stormy weather

[Chorus]

[Tre Williams]
Now I got to get, get myself together
Cuz I can't take no more, of this stormy weather
Now I wish you were here with me
I wish you were right here
I wish you were here with me, ooh

[Chorus]

[Tre Williams]
Night falls and I call for you, love
But there's no one here to answer
No, no, no, oh
The wind blows and I turn to catch ya
But there's no one there but my reflection
No, oh I said I wish you was here with me</pre>
