Song:   Soul Power (Black Jungle)
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Flav] Two thousand and two!
[Chef] Lookin like a tennis player
[Flav] Representin the Wu!
[Chef] You gangsta nigga?
[Flav] Two thousand and two!
[Chef] You?  You isn't!
[Flav] Representin the motherfuckin Wu!

[Flavor Flav]
Two thousand and two! .. You know how we do!
For you and your crew!  Representin the motherfuckin Wu!

[Raekwon the Chef]
Aiyyo catch me coolin in Aruba, one sneaker on
Lookin raw beautiful, a blue Ruger, who you lookin at?
600 whale, steel color, Brazil love us
Y'all niggaz is fake - all y'all do is steal from us
Remember this line, I'm that nigga word to my mother
Slap one of y'all fake ass niggaz
Reefer from Egypt daddy we rock magnums
All big niggaz heavy on the wrist play diss niggaz
Ghost story blow 'em, RZA throw the fork through 'em
Me, Wonder Woman cousin, jewelried out, talk to him
Hammers that bust endlessness, cover terrorism what?
Slide in the 7, measure the whips

[Chorus: Wu-Tang Clan] + (Flavor Flav)
It's soul power! (Two thousand and two!)
Soul power! (You know how we do!)
Soul power! (For you and your crew!)
Soul power! (Representin Wu!)
Soul power! (You know how we do!)
Soul power! (Two thousand and two!)
Soul power! (For you and your crew!)
Soul power! (Representin Wu!)

[Masta Killa]
I'm a dollar and a dream from seein a brick
In grimy hallways, slingin nicks and treys
When it's on then it's on and poppin, shots lickin
I'm spittin this shit for the hood, glock clickin
Tension in the street, we stressed, still wanna eat
I walk through the valley of death, the hotstepper
Holdin red pepper, everybody on reach
I need a beat to expand, the mind guide the hand
Pen stroke, excellent quotes of literature
Nights over Egypt, black as Arabia
Gundeliro(?) Self I savior, I need the (uh)

[Chorus: Wu-Tang Clan] + (Flavor Flav)
Soul power! (You know how we do!)
Soul power! (For you and your crew!)
Soul power! (Representin Wu!)
Soul power! (You know how we do!)
Soul power! (Two thousand and two!)
Soul power! (For you and your crew!)
Soul power! (Representin Wu!)

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyyo, aiyyo
Aiyyo I got the whip smellin like lemon
Roger Clemens jerseys the man blew seven cold coolies in the Worthy and
I crush those rappers, keep the toast near the rad-iator
We like our guns warm, it's easier to make the papers
Stayed off, the cape came off, Ghost G'd off
The track's like doin six months and I'ma beat off
At the airport attention always flow in my direction like
You let the best then sparkle his perfection and
Bitches be askin them, Ghost you got so much shit
You need to cash in, bracelets matchin 'em

[U-God]
Yo, yo
Line Cadillacs to blocks, Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx
Jukebox records, flatfooted cops
Get automatic systematic jumpin in your socks
Mama's apple pie in the park hopscotch
Reunited on the radio, Wu-Tang superb
In the sprinklers girls double-dutchin on the curb
Sinatra, the pop the Jackson 5 recordings
Uptown Saturday, "Cotton Came to Harlem"
Ringmaster circus was, Bailey and Barnum
Crack a Coca-Cola, summer heat was my boredom
Dr. J before Jordan, Al Green on the organ
When Rerun did the dance, the whole world saw him
The blackout fears, Foxxy Brown, Pam Grier
Ford motor gear, your life and times queer
"Smokey the Bear", Burt Reynolds gray hair
Throw 'em some gems, throw up your fists and say yeah, it's

[Chorus: Wu-Tang Clan] + (Flavor Flav)
Soul power! (Two thousand and two!)
Soul power! (You know how we do!)
Soul power! (For you and your crew!)
Soul power! (Representin Wu!)
Soul power! (You know how we do!)
Soul power! (Two thousand and two!)
Soul power! (For you and your crew!)
Soul power! (Representin Wu!)
