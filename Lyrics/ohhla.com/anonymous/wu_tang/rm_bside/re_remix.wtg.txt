Album:  White Label 12"
Song:   Reunited (Remix)
Typed by: ThaMasta@IName.Com

[Ol' Dirty Bastard *singin*]	[RZA]
Reunited cuz it feels so good   Yo, yo, niggaz ain't shit
Reunited cuz we're understood   Your bitch ain't shit
There's one perfect thing and   Your momma ain't shit
children this one is it         Your daddy ain't shit
We both we're so excited cuz    You ain't shit
we're reunited, hey! hey!       Niggaz ain't shit
                                Your momma ain't shit
                                Your daddy ain't shit
                                You ain't shit, you ain't shit
                                Yo, yo

[GZA]
Reunited, double LP, world excited
Struck a mass to the underground, industry ignited
from metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggaz come, try to burglarize the turf
Scattin off soft-ass beats, them niggaz rap happily
Tragically, that style, de-ter-iate, rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwin your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
Where I come from, gettin visual is habitual
De-mon-strate walkin on hot coal, in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural
Rhymin while impaired, dart hit your garment
Pierced your internals, streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparallel advantage
of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I'm known on the microphone as the rap professor
Casual dresser, you may dress fresher
The way that I speak this shit is energetic
My physique of meat is quick atheletic
Remove all MC's who disapprove
that my funky fresh particle always have the groove
You're jealous over me because you're not a competitor
You're just a donor, I'm the rap editor
Tryin to rock the mic when you get an appetite
All negative on the mic, I dislike
Try to rock the mic but only will reduce
Try to get loose, you juice as a youth
Not knowin to yourself that you shall be frozen
I'm the MC warrior, who has been chosen
to rock and shock beats, polite when I recite
Sulfur MC's, you are down right, out right
Try to be talkative, there's no alternative
Hide until I forgive, this motive
I am unique with the perfected physique
The objective of my rhyme is my own technique
I maintain the paradise on this Earth
with the shut the fuck up style for what this shit is worth
Watch a nigga catch a purse
Super-hero niggaz die
Do my dirt, get away and multiply
You bitches, ya nice guys
Always want bitch, because ya need mine
I pleased on how I get up on the stage and fuck up the show
Cuz nobody can't fuck with me!
You bootleggin buyin motherfuckers, don't do that with me
with all these child-support cases I got, I needs my money!
Earl for ages, a 100 and down, sacrifice ya baby to the underground
The best kept secret, how does it feel to be boxin in
like a skeleton, growin back ya skin?
When I was young, I was taught how to produce
the science of babies gettin loose
I turned white boys to Springsteen spruce
Black to spooks, gave the Chinese Bruce
I can't help it if my style is foggy, monster boogie
Get ya high on my patio, all come to see me movie
Bicthes, you're walkin on my dirt
We ain't sayin nuthin
I whisper in ya ear, make ya blink cold Pert
Love potion, plenty bones I put up
What!? What!? What!? What!?
You know what time it is,
mothefuckers!

[Ol' Dirty Bastard *singing*]    [Ms. Roxy]
Reunited and it feels so good    It's Wu mothefuckers
Reunited cuz we're understood    ah, Wu-Tang motherfuckers
There's one perfect thing
and children this one is it
We both we're so excited
cuz we're reunited, hey! hey!    It's Wu motherfuckers
                                 ah, Wu-Tang motherfuckers
                                 It's Wu motherfuckers
                                 ah, Wu-Tang motherfuckers
				 It's Wu motherfuckers
                                 ah, Wu-Tang motherfuckers
