{*glasses/jewelry tinkling*}
You my Daddy whore (2X)
{*laughing*}
[Cappa]	Whoever she gonna do anyway
	But bust it, bust it though baby, bust it
	Who else, who else is gonna...

[Verse One: Ol Dirty Bastard]
This is dedicated to all you bitches
Knew this bitch named Traj, she had a hella fine ass
Candy-ass, blew my hole in the past
Niggarette gave me gonorrhea
Pussy dick to the tippy toe like ballerina
Boy you shoulda seen her
She had a babyface creamer Purinas
Called up talkin Tina
I put my dick in her womb
She blew my head like a balloon
I had her walkin on the moon

[Verse Two: Cappadonna]
Yo, I seen you at the five and dime wastin your time
Oh you shine, I'm lookin at your ass from behind
You walked by smellin like watermelon
You might make me a felon, my eyeballs swellin
My nuts start yellin, excuse my prick
Wanna have a talk with you, I'm sick
My medicine is can I walk with you, fantasy
After that we can cheat, laid on the bed
Handcuffed with hard meat, long stroke smackin
Smack it then broke, nothin can't stop my
continous poke, compound
Porno flick music, Daddy came with it when I wrote it

[Verse Three: Ol Dirty Bastard]
Dirt Dog be bouncin on bitches like fog
I pollute the air up like smog, bitch
I'm up my jacuzzi, peepin this smoothie
My bitch is a floozy, Dirt Dog ain't choosy
Pussy move me, pretty black dick up in the booty
I like it muddy and swampy
By now you find your ass up shitty creeky
Don't got no fuckin room me and my momma in my teepee
Blackberry squeeze, bitch who a tease
Titties small, I got used to the squeeze
Fuck that shit, I'm through with this bitch
Old hen please can't get a bank of these
welfare cheese, now to blow fifty G's
overseas, I'm doin the breeze, in my 850

[Verse Four: RZA]
Suicidal, she been in more hotels than bibles
Idle worshippin bitch wasn't the type to make bridle
Sprung, on how the bitch maneuvered her tongue
From the top of his dick, to the bottom of his ass split
I told the God to jet quick this wicked bitch was a harlot
but had him trapped up inside the Charlotte Web
She wasn't choosy fucked for a movie and a loose leaf
cigarette, pussy stay wet and juicy like lemons
Big ass in tight denim
Had the most faithful niggaz sinnin against their women
and enjoyed, to watch relationships get destroyed
This unemployed welfare bitch was non-void
and shameless, her attitude was blameless
Even though she had a hundred dicks on her namelist
Her obsession, caused niggaz to get, the ass cheek injection
The bitched lied, said she had urinary tract infection
I tried to warn em, and bomb em, but she conned em
Wanted niggaz to fuck her raw dog without no condom

*woman moans* oooooh, ahahhh, ohh

[Wu-Tang movie samples]
        You people are all trying to acheive the impossible
That's exactly what we've done
        But you'll fail, and you'll all die
If we die, the next generation will fight them too
And the one after them, for as long as they must
And eventually we shall succeed</pre>
