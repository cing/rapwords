Artist: Wu-Tang Clan
Album:  A Better Tomorrow
Song:   Miracle
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus x2]
If a miracle, could save us from
The travesty, that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
The whole world trippin', listen it's still a cold world
The other day I had to bury my homegirl
Wrong place, caught one in her face
Plus her man's on the run and couldn't come to the wake
For Heaven's sake, you pray God open the gate
In this modern day Sodom, that's their only escape
10 year olds are cold, no, they don't hesitate
2 up a G pack, he chose the whole 8
Catch a 5 to 10 sellin' 5's and 10's
And the police informer was your childhood friend
In the real world, gotta hustle for your dream
Extend your clips, fit the muzzle with the beam
For the love of cream, it's nothin' but routine
Swing on the judge, take a couple for the team
He's the young Capone, he grew up in a drug home
Stranded on the Ave with a blunt and his gun shown

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Alive, seen things from the Godfather saga
A Martin Scorsese classic and I'm the author
Drama at the opera, crime story novel
Tuxedo suit and silencer on the nozzle
Meeting place scheduled at the Broadway musical
Bravo, we arrive in bulletproof limo
Shotgun, the underboss of our main source
Of interest, the black widow cocaine empress
A princess rich from her family's inheritance
Now let's talk business, begin by addressin' the bricks
That was missin' in the last shipment
At first, everything nice, everything routine
Jocks lining up the food, we blessed him with the cream
But on this day he wasn't ready and my God sense keen
I noticed that his normal firm handshake shook
It wasn't steady when he squeezed

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
He went from prince to a king out of a life of rubbish
Wearin' tailor-made suits, Sky Dwellers and clusters
To perfection, rags to riches, the evil's done influenced
That pushed him off the edge, they said the greed made him do it
You're my right hand, damn, he fucked the trust up
It's ruined, niggas caught him slidin' on his belly
I'm grippin' on my hammer with the silencer twisted
Contemplatin' murder now, I'm 'bout to swerve on my biscuit
But it's my man at the same time, I don't wanna do him
He violated, broke a major code, bar what you stealin' now
It's over, in the falls of Niagara, he was soakin'
With a shell case stuck in his head, they found him floatin'

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]
Allah let me lay in your arms
Hold me like a newborn, sing to me the most sweetest song
The exalted, the most benevolent
The knower of all, keep me safe 'till I return back to your residence
This Earth, my place of birth
As time went through the ages it got worse
Sicknesses, beheadings in Syria
Ebola's killin' my people, it's gettin' scarier
Most foods ain't even real, the chip is here
Deadly fluids bein' released, contracted through air
Dear God, it's been a minute since I cried out
Since mama died, I never wild out
We need help like the phone's 'bout to die out
Can you hear me? Can you hear me now?
We need a miracle
Destroy the FDA for holdin' back cures so they can get paid

[Chorus]</pre>
