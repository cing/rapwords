Artist: Wu-Tang Clan
Album:  A Better Tomorrow
Song:   Never Let Go
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Sample: Martin Luther King]
I am happy to join with you today
in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration
for freedom in the history of our nation
Five score years ago, a great American
in whose symbolic shadow we stand today

[Verse 1: Masta Killa]
Look, homicide is illegal, death is a penalty
Never let go when you've got ahold of your enemy
Eagle claw cobra clutch by any means necessary
I'll never let it go, see my shadow ninja mic flow
I throw a great entre dart arrow to your temple
Allmighty [?] to the insidious
Plan of the Wu-Tang Clan became a world brand
We never let it go, we talk a half a mil a show

[Verse 2: GZA]
Never let go of your mind
It's a terrible thing to waste
To lose, but it's very hard to find
Being that ignorance is lethal
We must touch hearts, tune souls, harmonize the people
Never let go of your plan, execute
So when you shoot, inspire everyone on the land
Never lose knowledge of yourself
For it may become risk to your health
And great loss of wealth

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Never let go of your cream, never let go of your dream
Players retire, but they never let go of the team
If you a rider then you never let go of that thing
Pull up your mans' like you better let go of that bling
This life's crazy, too many life sentences, maybe
Fatherless babies on the block but they father 380
That's just the hood lately, never let go
I'm what the hood made me
Momma told me to find a good lady

[Verse 4: Inspectah Deck]
Never let go of staring at the death
Like yo, that's your best blow
I still hold on like En Vogue
The cold go to war with the heat
Eyes wide, never falling asleep
All the talking is cheap
Call'em, ultimate warrior, W.W.F
I come up victorious, struggle is nothing to Deck
Set it straight for the seeds, to see a better new
Take the real life by the rings and I ain't letting go
I ain't letting go

[Chorus]
No matter what the odds be
No matter how hard we
You never let go

[Verse 5: U-God]
Never let go of the fight, never let go of the mic
My honesty, my values, my loyalty, my pride
And memory of those who have passed to the other side
Never letting go, I'm never letting go of my beliefs
My faith, convictions, real
Both hands holding on, never let go the wheel
We hood legends, misunderstood
These lessons, learned
Growing up for manhood
Keep focus on the prize what you better do
A little taste of heaven, sunshine is where we headed to
States what's ahead of you, always on the schedule
Smoke the gold leaf down to the residue
Letting go, is something that I never do
Those who let go, live life regrettable
Never let go of your hope or your rope
Eyes on the prize, never let go of the scope
When I'm in jail, never let go of the soap
Hold on, boy, never let go

[Verse 6: RZA]
Never let go, the all-eye-seeing, the supreme
Never let go the love of your seeds, or your queen
Never let go your heart, or the place you started
The feeling that I had, Wu-Tang had just charted
The old earth departed, I give thanks to the martyrs
I never let go the love I have for thy father
Never let go the glow
The more I know the more that it shows
I won't let go, even if I decompose
Your seed will carry it on, we need to carry it on
Pass the baton, life is just the marathon
And ain't' playing to win it, it's an epidemic
Never let go, that's what the god recommended

[Chorus]

[Sample: Martin Luther King]
And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America
The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations
of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges
Who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice
For many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today
have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny
And they have come to realize that their freedom
is inextricably bound to our freedom</pre>
