Artist: Wu-Tang Clan
Album:  A Better Tomorrow
Song:   Felt
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: RZA]
Feelings. The emotional side of a man, woman or a child's character
A response or tendency to respond
A belief, which can be vague, illogical, but emotionally irrational

[Verse 1: Masta Killa]
I never gave a fuck on how the next nigga felt
I rocked a heavyweight belt cause that's the way I felt
Still feel, so inspired to write a rhyme that's ultimately
No other emcee could get with me, is way I felt
Don't forget the first time you heard me rhyme the way
The first time you heard "Protect Ya Neck", the way you felt
Like no other hip hop record ever made you felt
Cards dealt, played my handle, when no matter how I felt

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Every time we touch the mic, you know our lyrics is felt
Worldwide, live, polaroid shit, all my homies is
And we ride out to all of our music is
Yeah, we gets busy, teach the youth because we know how it felt
Give em Knowledge of self expressing in a way that it's felt
So each and every person to recognize what they felt
Watch your mind state because the evil could be felt
You never know, how when I first came out, how my brothers felt
I've been going through it, plus a lot of deep pain was felt
We would last for a night, but a better tomorrow

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
I felt the angel of death breathe
When I felt the four fifths something told me squeeze
I felt like it was the end of a dynasty
Like I was fighting a clique of five Chinese thieves
Karate slippers with slip on's so I kept slippin'
The floor was too smooth felt like I couldn't catch a grip in
Felt like Dragonfly Jones, was Dragonfly Tone
So I kept spitting, woke up when I heard the phone

[Verse 4: Method Man]
I never gave a what on how the next rapper felt
I take that rapper's belt myself, I feel how Cappa felt
I don't really need help, use a sharpie, don't need the felt
Marker, walk on water, I see how Jesus felt
No rhyme or reason, just bleeding, my every breathing's felt
This about a thesis that even paraplegics felt
These boys ain't needing, they barely breathing, believe it, seen it
Till you got cheated, you couldn't tell me how cheating felt
I'm not a failure, I couldn't tell ya how losing felt
Might not have nailed her, but I can tell ya how spooning felt
Remember when you first heard the rap and the way it felt
I burned the track with a murder rap and I know it's felt

[Chorus]</pre>
