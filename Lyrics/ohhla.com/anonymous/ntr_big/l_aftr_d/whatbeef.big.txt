I put my key you put your key in, money we'll be seein
Will reach the fuckin ceiling, check, check it
My Calico been cocked (uh-huh) this rap Alfred Hitchcock

This instant, rappers too persistant
Quick to spit Biggie name on shit, make my name taste

your jewelry you can keep it, that be our little secret
See me, B that is, I that is, G whiz
Motherfuckers still in my biz
Don't they know my nigga Gutter fuckin kidnip kids? (uhh)
Fuck em in the ass, throw em over the bridge (oooh)
That's how it is, my shit is laid out (what)
Fuck that beef shit, that shit is played out (played out)
Y'all got the gall, all I make is one phone call
All y'all dissapear by tomorrow
All your guns is borrowed, I don't feel sorrow
Actually, your man passed the gat to me, now check this

What's beef?  Beef is when you need two gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, one more time
What's beef?  Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, check it

I done smoked with the best of em (uh-huh) shot at the rest of em (uh-huh)
Was about a hundred or more, maybe less of em
Got my rocks off, that nigga from the Brook just be
whylin on you just be, stylin on you (you so crazy)
When I, tried to warn you but your eyes fucked up
Now I cleared them shits with hits you on the fuckin bench (mmm)
Pardon my French but ahh, sometimes I get kinda
peeved at these, weak MC's (don't stop) with the
supreme baller like, lyrics I call em like I see em G
Y'all niggaz sound like me (yeah)
Y'all was grimy in the early nineties, far behind me
It ain't hard to find me number one with the booyaka (booyaka)
Gimme the Remi and the chronic ain't no tellin what I do to ya (I do to ya)
It's obvious the game's new to ya (new to ya)
Take them ends you make (ehehe)
and spend em on a tutor hah, one shot, I'm through with ya

What's beef?  Beef is when you need two gats to go to sleep (don't sleep)
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets (ain't safe)
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU (I see you) one more time
What's beef?  (What's beef) Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep
(Start my Jeep) Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep (thirty deep)
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, check it (I see you)

There'll be nothin but smooth sailin (sailin)
When I spit shots, now your crew's bailin (bailin)
All I got is heat and tough talk for you (uh-huh)
Tie you up, cut your balls off just to use (oooh)
Man listen straight torture, look what that slick shit bought ya
A first class ticket to Lucifer, real name Cristopher
Watch me set it off like Vivica
Here lies your demise, close your eyes (uh-huh)
Think good thoughts, die while your skin start to glisten
Pale blue hands get cold, your soul's risen
It's bad cause I just begun, what make the shit real bad
I was havin fun (ahaha!)

What's beef? (What's beef?) Beef is when you need two gats to go to sleep
(Don't sleep) Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets (ain't safe)
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, one more time (I see you)
What's beef? (What's beef?) Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep
(Start my Jeep) Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep (thirty deep)
Beef is when I see you (I see you)
