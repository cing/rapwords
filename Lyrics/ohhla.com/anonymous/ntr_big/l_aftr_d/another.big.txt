Artist: Notorious B.I.G. f/ Lil' Kim
Album:  Life After Death
Song:   Another
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Big] Yeah... fuck you
[Kim] Fuck you too!
[Big] Fuck you bitch
[Kim] Fuck you motherfucker
[Big] You ain't shit anyway, fuck you
[Kim] You ain't shit, you fat motherfucker
[Big] Yeah, whatever whatever
[Kim] Whatevah
[Big] You wasn't sayin that when you was suckin my dick
[Kim] You wasn't sayin that when you was eatin my pussy!
[Kim] You a nasty motherfucker!
[Big] Check it, uhh
[Kim] Crab ass

[Chorus One: B.I.G.]
What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue?
You cut that hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (another bitch), in my life

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Uh-huh, uhh, uhh
I know he don't treat you like I treat you
Time to explain your game is see-through
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try
Like this y'all, my girl sucked anotha nigga dick y'all
Light skinned with the chromed out six y'all
Thought they was creepin, took trips to V-A every third weekend
While you was sleepin, he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine code non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trialed
Way I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you was my right thing
Then things got frightening
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man Trigga, my ace boom coon
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon
Now I'm like Brandy, "Sittin in My Room"
Pissy drunk listenin to Stylistic tunes
Or the O'Jays, thinkin bout the old days
My nigga's like, "Fuck that bitch, go play
Baller, did she beep you?  Don't call her
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula
She was askin bout ya whereabouts
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight
You'll be all fuckin night"

[Chorus Two: Lil' Kim]
What do ya do when your man is untrue?
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new?
I need another man, in my life

[Lil' Kim]
Mmm, uhhh, uhhh!
Member when you said you would die for me, shit
All of that was just lies to me
Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me
Now you cry for me, like Jodeci
It's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all
Black nasty and mad fat y'all; shoulda seen the hoe
Nigga pack ya shit, tou out the do', ohh
What about the fight in the Mirage?
I seen ya Benz, parked outside my sister's garage
Said it was ya friend Rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin up wit the bullshit
And still I, never sweat these bitches
who be hanged like plaques on the wall and ya pictures
Scalin fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin ya heat in the passenger seat
of the Nautica Jeep, we've been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin to hold on
Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin
Girls steady screamin, "Kim you need to leave him!"
When I testified in court
Couldn't think straight thinkin bout the bitches I fought
over you, nigga half the shit you bought
And fuck you, movin is my last resort
You see nine outta ten niggaz, ain't shit
One outta five niggaz suck a dick
Ya mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me
Choulda kept the freak bitch off my canape
Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine
Long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this
When I sucked ya dick, it's like smokin a roach
Uhh, why go from first class to coach?

[Chorus One]
[Chorus Two]
