Artist: Notorious B.I.G. f/ Puff Daddy, Too $hort
Album:  Life After Death
Song:   The World is Filled...
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

"Make it hot" - Notorious B.I.G. (repeat 4X)

		The world is filled, with pimps and hoes
		We'll just talk about those I knows
		The world is mine, can't you see
		I'm just trying to be all I can be
		Ohhahhoahh, yeah

Verse One: Puff Daddy

Now first come the cash, then come the ass
Then come big blunts with big chunks of hash
When I score with a whore she be game for sure
Pimp so hard, a nigga drag his mink on the floor
Won't you admit it?  I ain't gotta talk because I live it
Any chick fuckin with me, believe me that's a privelege
I won't be satisfied, till all my niggaz get it
See you hit it then I hit it, we get it back to split it
And Big be that nigga we be flyin through your hood
And hoodrats scopin with they eyes on my goods
See we date em like we hate em, see em like we don't need em
Treat em like we meet em, and never give up freedom
And we only give our number to selected few
And it's best that you, never knew, what good head'll do
Turn a freak to a bisexual
and if she's flexible fuck the nigga next to you

"Make it hot" - Notorious B.I.G. (repeat 4X in the background)

                The world is filled, with pimps and hoes
                But we'll just talk about those I knows
                The world is mine, can't you see
                I'm just trying to be all I can be
                Ohhahhoahh, yeah

Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G.

When the Remi's in the system, ain't no tellin
Will I fuck em will I diss em, that's what these hoes yellin
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all still chase on, I'll replace on, punks
Drunk of Dom, silk and gators
Spittin words makin birds till they flock see you later
Whether, drunk or high, skunk or thai
Nigga play against some playa shit, slugs gon fly
Ain't no lie, pimped out, the SSI
Nigga don't ask why, just respect it
She bought me the necklace, the bracelet
The Benz-o, she laced it
Crib-o, got it, interior decorated
Now my popularity grew, in each state
Now I got two in each state
Used to drink brew and eat steak
Now I pop bottles with models, larger steaks on large estates

"Make it hot" - Notorious B.I.G. (repeat 4X in background)

                The world is filled, with pimps and hoes
                But we'll just talk about those I knows
                The world is mine, can't you see
                I'm just trying to be all I can be
                Ohhahhoahh, yeah

Verse Three: Too $hort

I had a whole lotta bitches in my lifetime
I been blessed with the game always say the right lines
Had a few prostitues and if you knew the truth
They're like pimps, you can't let em do it to you
She ain't no sucker, I know that bitch man
She wanna be a Pretty Woman lovin a rich man
Now here you come, drop top ridin
You ain't no pimp fake nigga stop lyin
Pussy makes money, stick to the business
Think about the real motherfuckers that live it
Street life, pimp shit, make the hoe respect the game
You bought her diamonds and cars, trick that's a shame
Say what you want, but I still figured
She left you cause you couldn't be, like them real niggaz
She was a hustler by nature, and you was just faker
than the average symps, found a badder pimp
Too $hort

Crazy ass man
I never woulda bought that bitch all them cars 
and all that shit you bought that hoe man
After I heard about what the bitch did nigga, knew the hoe!
Man I'm thirty years old nigga
And that bitch was hoein when I was in 9th grades and shit
Think about that, she been around then right?
Shit... you just a rest haven for hoes man
Just the first nigga that came along when the bitch got out the pen
Bitch only fuckin witchu cause you had a good ass job, nigga nerd
Treat the bitch better than anybody ever treated her
Stupid ass nigga
She ain't nuttin but a hoe!
Bet you fell in love with her man!
You can't turn a hoe into a housewife fool
Everytime you turn your back that bitch is fuckin with dem gangstas
Eastside Westside these are my potnahs
Do that shit, you know what I'm talkin bout nigga
I tell you about some real pimps and hoes
Tell you about these pimps and these hoes man, yeah I know a few
Shit, beyotch!
