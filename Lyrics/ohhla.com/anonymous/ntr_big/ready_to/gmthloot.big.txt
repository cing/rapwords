Artist: Notorious B.I.G. 
Album:  Ready to Die 
Song:   Gimme the Loot 
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yeah
Motherfuckers better know... huh, huh
Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls, huh... yeah
(*scratching* "I'm a bad, bad, boy..")

[Notorious B.I.G.] 
My man Inf left a Tec and a nine at my crib 
Turned himself in, he had to do a bid 
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G, you with me? 
  Motherfucking right, my pocket's looking kind of tight 
  and I'm stressed, yo Biggie let me get the vest 
No need for that, just grab the fucking gat 
The first pocket that's fat the Tec is to his back 
Word is bond, I'm a smoke him yo don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing: stick and move, stick and move 
  Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit 
  I've been robbin motherfuckers since the slave ships 
  with the same clip and the same four-five 
  Two point-blank, a motherfucker's sure to die
  That's my word, nigga even try to bogart 
  have his mother singing "It's so hard..."
Yes Love, love your fucking attitude
because the nigga play pussy that's the nigga that's getting screwed 
and bruised up from the pistol whipping 
welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too 
up the herring bones and bamboos 
I wouldn't give fuck if you're pregnant 
Give me the baby rings and a #1 MOM pendant 
  I'm slamming niggaz like Shaquille, shit is real 
  When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal 
  cause Mom Duke ain't giving me shit 
  so for the bread and butter I leave niggaz in the gutter 
  Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous 
  Crazier than a bag of fucking Angel Dust 
  When I bust my gat motherfuckers take dirt naps 
  I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?
(*sample* "But he's sticking you, and taking all of your money..")

[Chorus 8X]
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
(*scratching* "I'm a bad, bad, boy..")

[Notorious B.I.G.] 
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up 
and I'm shooting niggaz quick if you hiccup 
Don't let me fill my clip up in your back and head piece 
The opposite of peace sending Mom Duke a wreath 
You're talking to the robbery expert 
Stepping to your wake with your blood on my shirt 
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant 
cause when I lick shots the shits is persistent 
  Huh, goodness gracious the papers
  Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
  Nigga, pass that before you get your grave dug
  from the main thug, .357 slug
  And my nigga Biggie got an itchy one grip 
One in the chamber, 32 in the clip 
Motherfuckers better strip, yeah nigga peel 
before you find out how blue steel feel 
  from the Beretta, putting all the holes in your sweater 
  The money getter motherfuckers don't have better 
  Rolex watches and colourful Swatches 
  I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop it 
Man, niggaz come through I'm taking high school rings too 
Bitches get *strangled* for they earrings and bangles
and when I rock her and drop her I'm taking her door knockers 
And if she's resistant "baka! baka! baka!"
  So go get your man bitch he can get robbed too 
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
  I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
  and if I set it the cocksucker won't forget it
(*sample* "But he's sticking you, and taking all of your money..")

[Chorus 8X]
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
(*scratching* "I'm a bad, bad, boy..")

[Notorious B.I.G.]
  Man, listen all this walking is hurting my feet 
  But money looks sweet (where at?) in the Isuzu jeep 
Man, I throw him in the Beem, you grab the fucking C.R.E.A.M 
and if he start to scream "bam! bam!", have a nice dream 
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car 
Fur coats and diamonds, she thinks she a superstar 
  Ooh Biggie, let me jack her, I kick her in the back 
  Hit her with the gat...
Yo chill, Shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block 
The bitch act shocked, gettin shot on the spot 
(Oh shit! The cops!) Be cool, fool 
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts 
(So why the fuck he keep lookin?) I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see Central Booking 
Oh shit, now he lookin in my face 
You better haul ass cause I ain't with no fucking chase 
So lace up your boots, cause I'm about to shoot 
A true motherfucker going out for the loot </pre>
