Artist: The Notorious B.I.G. f/ CJ Wallace, Diddy, Faith Evans
Album:  Notorious Soundtrack
Song:   One More Chance/The Legacy Remix
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[CJ Wallace] + (Diddy) + {B.I.G.}
Uhh...
What? (That's right)
That's right, uhh, uhh
Bad Boy, what? Uhh, uhh
{Uhh, what? Uh}
{Uhh, uhh, what? Lyrically I'm}
{Uhh, uhh} Uhh, uhh, check it out
{Uhh, uhh} Uhh, lyrically I'm
{Uhh... uhh, uhh}
{What?} What? {Uhh, Junior M.A.F.I.A.}
{Uhh} Junior M.A.F.I.A. (Remix)
CJ, uhh

[Verse One: Biggie] + (CJ)
(First things first) I Poppa, freaks all the honies
Dummies, Playboy bunnies, those wantin money
Those the ones I like cause they don't get nathan
but penetration, unless it smells like sanitation
Garbage, I turn like doorknobs
Heartthrob, never, black and ugly as ever
(However, I stay Coogi down to the socks)
(Rings and watch filled with rocks)
(And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi)
(Girls pee pee when they see me)
(Navajos creep me in they teepee)
(As I lay down laws like Alan Coppet)
(Stop it, if you think you're gonna make a profit)
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns - get it
Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it, then split it
in two (as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A.)
(I don't know what the hell's stoppin ya)
(I'm clockin ya, Versace shade watchin ya)
(Once ya grin, I'm in - game begin)
(First I talk about how I dresses this)
(in diamond necklasses, stretch Lexuses)
The sex is just immaculate from the back I get
Deeper and deeper, help ya reach the
climax that your man can't make
(Call him, tell him you'll be home real late)
(Now sing the break, uhh)

[Chorus One: Faith Evans] + (CJ & Biggie)
Baby, here I am (I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
All, I need, is one, more chance... one more chance
I, can help, you find, yourself (I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
You, don't need, nobo-dy else... one more chance (remix)

[Verse Two: Biggie] + (CJ)
She's sick of that song on how it's so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
(There I is; Major Payne like Damon Wayans)
(Low Down, Dirty even, like his brother Keenan)
Schemin, don't leave ya girl 'round me
True player for real (ask Puff Daddy)
You ringin bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel
(Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell)
(She beeped me, meet me at twelve)
(Where you at?) Flippin jobs, payin car notes?
While I'm swimmin in ya women like the breast stroke
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke - tongue all down her throat
Nuttin left to do but send her home to you
I'm through, (can ya sing the song for me boo?)

[Chorus Two: Faith Evans] + (CJ & Biggie) + {CJ}
One more chance, Biggie give me one more chance
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
{Uhh, what? Uhh... uhh, uhh ya didn't know? Uhh}
One more chance, Biggie give me one more chance
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
{Uhh, uhh, uhh.. what? What) One more chance

[Verse Three: CJ] + (Biggie)
So, what's it gonna be, him or me?
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crushed linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em
(Finest women I love with a passion)
(Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin)
(High fashion, flyin into all states)
(Sexin me while ya man masturbates)
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight
(Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds)
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only a client, I'm the Player President

[Chorus Two] - 1/2X + [Chorus One]

[Outro: Diddy] + (Biggie)
Bad Boy, Bad Boy
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
East coast... West coast...</pre>
