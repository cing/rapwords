Artist: Blige, Mary J. f/ Notorious B.I.G, Puff Daddy
Album:  What's The 411? - The Remixes
Song:   What's The 411? (Remix)
Typed by: dallas@gdi.net

[Puff Daddy]
Oh shit (what's that man)
I don't know kid, I think it's a party going on
Oh it's the remix
Check it, yeah muthafuckas
What we about to do right about now
We gonna get kinda funky
I am the Puff Daddy
And I'm rolling with my man Biggie Smalls,
Mary J. Blige and J-C from Jodeci
And we about to do something new
And we about to
Check it, say what, say what

CHORUS:
[Biggie]
Hey yo, what's the 411, hun
(What's the 411, hun)
I know you got it going on
(Hey yo, I got it going on)

[Biggie]
As I sit back relax
Steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex
I'd probably go to jail 
For fuckin Patti Labelle
Ooh Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly
Mariah Carey, kinda scary
Wait a minute what about my honey Mary
The jeans they fittin like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses
I'ma show ya who the boss of intercourse is
Sex, I'm takin no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC
Can't see B-I-G with telepathy
The recipe, a picture hardcore with a gun
Pimpin ain't easy but it's always fun
When it comes to nuts, I bust'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1 hun

CHORUS

[Mary J. Blige]
Yeah nigga, what makes you better than the next nigga
Seen you last week in your black ass car, freak
You try to play like Mr all of that
But now you wanna come to me with some chit-chat
I don't have no time for no wham-bam thank you mam
Gas me up, get me drunk and hit, then you scram
The same old shit you pulled last week on Pam
I'm not having it, no I'm not having it
You got to do a lot more of this, that how it be
I'm Mary Blige and you just ain't running up in me
I need a man who's looking out for some security
So come correct with some respect, and then we'll see
So if you with it, then rock the 7-digits
And I might just give you a call (Damn)
If you ain't with it then don't waste your time at all
Biggie Smalls, and you don't stop

All my love dreams that I've had
And my dreams are very special
All my life I've looked for you
And you make the dream come true
You make me another you
Love like this is kind of special
Things you seem to do devine
This is ours to combine
I know our love must make a begining
Love is life and life is living

[Puff Daddy]
I like, the sexiest muthafucka
And I want to bust the 411
'94 is here
We gonna have something new for you on this next album, man
Yeah, we gonna have something new for your asses
We going to keep it funky
Yeah, it's a Bad Boy thing
My man Raj on the remix tip
Yeah, big shouts to the uptown crew
Ugh, to all the people in the Bronx and nation
Funk nation that is, that recorded the album
My man Busta Rhymes, my man Grand Puba, check it
Ugh, yeah, Flip Gray in the house
My man Buttnaked, Tim Dawg, ugh</pre>
