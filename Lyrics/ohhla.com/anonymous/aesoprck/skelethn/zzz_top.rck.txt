Artist: Aesop Rock
Album:  Skelethon
Song:   ZZZ Top
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Somebody in a cultivated moment of distress
Composed himself to artfully carve Zoso in his desk
They was probably thinking fuck you fuck you fuck you in they head
With a hell bound arm and a acidy wash
Homemade curfew a thousand o'clock
And a pot leaf tattoo his friend did drunk
Like a badge of mystique that technically sucked
Taking the name of the father in vain
On the way to the blade in his locker
it's strange
A switch he lifted from a siblings skivvy drawer
Who branched off into ninja stars
And never knew his shit was sharp
To here with a higher purpose
And a prime alert to juvenile beserkers
Like kush Van Morrison an Arcade Drop Floor
Down to the valley time for miss Ahkmar
watch
Capital Z (ed)
slowly maneuver the O
S is the most difficult to control
Finally O
Into the eye of Goliath you goes
That levee crushing percussion
Will pull the monkey up right
Twelve or ghetto blaster
Blacken her technicolor telecaster
Lecture at a faster rate
The class was making them develop backwards
It would appear you spelled out all the answers

Somebody in a cultivated moment of distrust
composed themselves enough to magic-marker "Zulu" on these chucks
they was tryin to do the buckle font from 'renegades of funk'
in a 3d frame of exploding brick
and whiz-lines for the locally motion sick
beyond gross but evoked a host of "oh dip"
where a social neurosis owned the whole strip
heart of a cat with a lark in his mouth
in the marrow of waiting his guardians out
flashlight
chisel tips
milked venom
pistol grip
images relocated from milled vellum to scissor kick
silent agreement at hand
king of the hill for a queen of the damned
she in the doorway seething began "that clean white pair had a 3-year planl"
oops
capital "zed"
radical "u" in the cut
truly to beautiful "l"oser it up
and he done
collateral damage a future alum
that key to Shambala
planet rocking
Bambaatta
sample chop
churning out a cancer for the vandal squad
analog
and he finds
animated colors on a page
like synthesized cultures on a stage

Somebody in a cultivated moment of resolve
composed themselves enough to publicize "the Zeros" in this stall
they was scoping every dog and pony previously scrawled
with a festering hate for the gum drop edge
'disco sucks' tee
punk's not dead
but a transient teen unsung godsend
via 3 bar chords and a mugshot grin
cheese
sign of a runaway tone in the face of authority thumbing nose
cutting it's teeth
Pretzled up in special order vinyl
and birds that dip their belts in little metal porcupine quills
2 dutch at a show in the front
low-key to the can for a smoke and a fuck
Trixie
fixing her lipstick up
when his mitts got bit by the mischief bug
snatchl
capital "zed"
terrible "e" in vermillion red
gimme an "0" and a slippery "s"
over a web of the shittiest bands
that beat your heart out
never bleeped your favorite parts out from a learned curve
of bird fingers bursting out of germs burns
urgently
offered through the circuits ofan earlier plot
I'll see you at the

When they ask how you
feeling you
tell em you
feeling like
something important died screaming
you
tell em you
feeling like
something even more important arrived breathing
something you should probably try feeding
When they as how you
living you
tell em you
living like
something important died hissing
you
tell em you
living like
something even more important arrived giving
something you should probably try willing</pre>
