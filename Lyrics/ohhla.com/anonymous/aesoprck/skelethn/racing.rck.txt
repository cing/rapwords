Typed by: AZ Lyrics

There is a bowl cut template mapped with a billy can
Mega morn scissoring a topiary lego man
Mini-ramp cowlick
Good ship snot nose
Lap rain water out of pigeon hill potholes
Rat brain, shovel green peas offa butterknife
Racoon hat, moon boots all summer-type
Felt pressure at the center of the dog show
Better off blending
Sweater—off Waldo you
Wanna see a genome mutate?
Cut a page boy ‘til it bring home a Cube tape
Poof, screw-face wriggle out a chop shop
Home-brewed Kool-aid, d
Isavowing Osh Kosh
Simulating television
Little rowdy rock snob
Bobble-headed shredder playing top-heavy hop scotch
You realize you only got a week
‘til you catch him with a set of shitty clippers in the sink
Like bzzzzt, motherfucking bzzzzt, bzzzzt
That's a quiet kid, buzzing asymmetric rebel lines in
Crudely, some say to praise the lord
I say you wanna feel saved baby
Shape the orb, and I will see you all in Helven
Read he fled a panic room pissed
And been searching for animal chin since
Bumpin' Johnny Rad, eye on the sauce pan
Current mop: 4 months shy on the off-chance

Start with a text book bowl cut (bowl cut!)
One you can mow down slow as you grow up learn a couple great new curse words
(pussy!) buzz a cool rat tail, take 2, your turn
Learn a couple great new curse words
(fuckface!) maybe try a ponyhawk, take 2, your turn

I knew this kid Camu
Who in the lion's mouth
Made up a fail safe way to get his life corralled
Let's say he short on the rent
His land lord is upset
He disappears with sheers yelling "I'm going George Jeff"
Bathroom door sound like a part—mech barbershop quartet
Forced into war with itself
What emerge next in a shaft of light is bald up top
Long on the back and sides
Maybe the blade oil came with a ax to grind
But granddaddy half-smile, all mastermind
He ask "how do I look?''
I said "you look insane"
He said the haircut come with a theory I'll explain
Please do
First: no hats allowed
Faux nat' male pattern when he out the house
And wouldn't crop it up until his monopoly prop pass go
‘til then walk this town like an asshole
Motherfucking bzzzt!
Last week we were stoney
This week he program beats all monday
Sold 2 wednesday, pay rent
Fabricate a whole new hedge maze
Back on his smooth shit friday at noon bitch
Wow, just like that
A method I encourage you to share and apply and adapt as one day his didn't grow back

Start with a text book bowl cut (bowl cut!)
One you can mow down slow as you grow up learn a couple great new curse words
(pussy!) buzz a cool rat tail, take 2, your turn
Learn a couple great new curse words
(fuckface!) maybe try a ponyhawk, take 2, your turn</pre>
