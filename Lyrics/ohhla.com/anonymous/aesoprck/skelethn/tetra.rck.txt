Artist: Aesop Rock
Album:  Skelethon
Song:   Tetra
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Don't fool with his cool

I turn a staff to a snake and back, evade crack
Shake a 5150 in shades and a fake stache
Dirtbike made of 5 worse bikes, uphill
Tabletop frames on dutch tilt, crush kill
MakerBot coin-op arcade punk
Talkin' arcane science, dark age pulp
Four eyes card face, bark Aes iron on [?]
Pork rinds orange age, Jarred brains die alone
No Mulligans, crow bars bird cage
Cold, colonize Mars on Earth day
And surface from the cellar door like worms into the petrichor
Messenger, better get a vessel for a Tetris score
Zilch, cowabunga homies call me "press ignore"
Devastating energy exploding off his Tesla coil
Farm baited breath and tempermental tremors
That taught a man to wave with 10 percent of his fingers
And I never lost tic tac toe to a live chicken
For the footage, I'm off cam dynamite fishin'
For diamondback rattles in his holy grail
Evoke colony collapse via gross betrayal
3 wolf moon shirt, two shoes one sock
Wore the same hoodie everyday like Mumm-Ra
Buh-dum-bum, follow the regenerated rebel flesh [?]
Out of sorts, out of water, suicidal tetra fish
Who stood by the conviction in his we should be together less forevermore
Before we are the severed heads of civil war
And basing [?] radio ricochet off the silver foil
Trash can fire looking for a kill to grill or spoil
Quickly, purveyors of fine hijinks
I know, this is why we can't have nice things
I prefer to skip the pleasantries
Flip the diner table, dip in time for final jeopardy

No shit
Oh and don't fool with his cool
Ma, can we get a pool?
... Is that a no?

Okay, magpies, Hoarders, and allied forces
Who lick zig-zags being dragged by horses
Transcribe stories in patterns of pins dropping
Skinned boars and exaggerated limb-lopping
Slow Mozart, no I've never heard a knocking
Might've burst in on it, splits or skin popping [?]
Opt out, sober on the eve of no saints day
Locate and aim for the token propane tank
Bang! Followed from a pulling of hair
To a homecoming sullied by a skull on a spear
It spun a human resources issue to public affair
Reciprocity is a pestilent compulsion to bear
And ultimately unfulfilling, concurrently that rigid upper lipping grudge or crippling [?]
The wonder twins are bitching
Armchair hater, I wouldn't piss on your coffin
But when I see your picture I draw dicks on it
The ozone breakaway tux
Holds chicken wire ribs and paper mache guts
Pipe cleaner mustache, fork hands, google eyes
Macaroni gas face, no plan to humanize
You are now rockin' with the worst
Nothing up his sleeve, nothing here is what it seems
Paranormal weather, mysteriously disappearing bees
Not to mention the collateral delirium it breeds
Jeez, forgive him and he dicey past
He from a tiny town called Deaths Icy Grasp
And he don't get out much but when he do it's beetlemania
Do not be asleep at the feet of his feelers radius
Too charitable, offerin' the average joe some real estate
Between the big mouth billy bass and jackalope
Cozy in a moment of bliss
Snatch the food off your plate, snatch a goat off a bridge
No shit</pre>
