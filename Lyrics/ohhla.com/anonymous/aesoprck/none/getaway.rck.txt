[Breeze Brewin]
Hey yo, hey yo, I send this to all of my corporate corpses 
Tryna abort the thoughts of coming out wild'n
Dumbin' out time to off the office, I was surely sorta twisted
Worked at a TV studio, an audio assistant 
Easy, do my duty though at times was in a mean mood 
Hot I gotta be cool, on the brink of fiend's drool 
Glaring at the green room, made a brother the same color, but beyond neon (Huh)
Pushin' me to peon, barkin' at dreams to be gone (Yeah)
tending to the talent and many they haven't any
Was especially a challenge when he be like God damn it 
Can he hear his vocal (Huh)
As he cuffin it, “How my mic sound?”
Thinkin' on the low it's perfect when he put the mic down
clown stand steady grillin' wanting subservience 
Sound man buryin' thinkin' I'd fuckin' murder them 
and I'm steamin' as I'm watchin' duke
leavin' on some hot pursuit, 
I gotta win, as these cats be modelin' what not to do

...Six in the morning and the walls close in, 
high noon calls and the walls own him 
Kings at the ready know the walls won't win (*Echoes*) - - > Aesop Rock

[Aesop Rock]
Huh, storms on the harbor like a harbinger of gore (Right)
Gore is my harbinger, pardon The Art of War (Right)
Get your doors darkened by
the house of card carpenters who never
thought a slave could be a sparticus and more
Pencil sharpener with a resume for the carnivores 
who take important conference calls in corner office walls
Still a buck is a buck and he punch numbers
Five-punch! 
Just say no to company functions 
and he duck into the dungeons
Nothing says “Kill it” like a day of fetching
paperclips and staplers for the privileged
Two lives, one is chores for whores, 
one is where I want to be when you begin regretting yours, 
and I poured in with a large coffee 
Tardy every morning, to a man who took authority beyond 
what it was for, how you gonna pay the rent day-job-free? 
Make rap records, matter of fact, thanks, peace

...Six in the morning and the walls close in, 
high noon calls and the walls own him 
Kings at the ready know the walls won't win (*Echoes*) - - > Aesop Rock

[Cage]
In a hospital gown day off from being tied down in recreation 
Swinging a paddle at mental patients
Raping the competition to smother the pain and sin,
so he pound you out in table tennis like Wang Liqin 
Too strange within just to stop
Demented interactions sleep and thoughts documented
He's lingering insane paint thinner in his vein 
colors blown out around the doctors finger in his brain
With a needle unable to beat him in a fetal position
he crafted a path to escape his condition
Would cling to the white walls the psych halls 
in his mind soon bled the words he would speak to the world in time, 
but not before more injections strapped to the bed
until the psycho-tropics took hold of the rap in his head 
When his wrists released, he wrote tunes you could snoop through
Day of release said, "Depart from me, I never knew you."

...Six in the morning and the walls close in, 
high noon calls and the walls own him 
Kings at the ready know the walls won't win (*Echoes*) - - > Aesop Rock
