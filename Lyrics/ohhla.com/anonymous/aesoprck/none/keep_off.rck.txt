Song:   Keep Off the Lawn

[Intro]
Good evening!
Alright... Yeah!
Happy to be breathing..
Yeah!
I am alive..
Yeah!
(I am alive...)
Yeah..

[Bridge]
(You look like you've seen a ghost.)
(You look like you've seen a ghost.)

[Verse I/II]
Most copious
Rain soak the opiates
Notice how the phobias appropriately procreate
Woke up with a ghost farm focused on his groceries
When they aren't telling stories, they are multiplying grossly on the lawn
Let 'em loiter, never let 'em spawn
The apparitions have been drinking this water for too long
So when they gather by the birdbath in the morning he will tell 'em
“I mean no disrespect, but you have all outstayed your welcome.”
Interesting, in a sense..
Interrupt commiserating phantoms on your picket fence
How quickly they will lift their heads
And breathe an ultimatum like, “The dead don't argue.”
Said, "You're living by the bayonet, but how alive are you?"
Shit, 'A' is all juice and bad etiquette
Elbows on the table, lobster bibbing on the ready-set
He said, “But how alive?”
“I don't know homey, you decide.”
(“No, you decide.”)
Fine..

[Chorus]
How alive? Too alive..
How alive? Too alive..
How alive? Too alive..

[Verse II/II]
And one by one around the yard, till each one felt communal pride
Like they had done their little part in cleaning up the public
With a steaming plate of justice for them Easy Baker stomachs (Say what?)
We the legends that home with the unremembered
Geriatric lore in the clutch of the budding censor
Who snuck around the art police and all related governments
To infiltrate a human lung and hike up off his tongue and lip
Ahh...
Money's in the market for a mother ship
Double as a vessel that drag its legacy under it
And who am I to hang them out to dry by the heap?
When if rehydrating fails, we're all dumber because of me
Zombies of the antiquated nation chatter quietly
The too alive channel from the library of rivalry
And summer's in the mud, winter's by the tracks
No story goes untold, Aes is back!

[Bridge]
I got a handful rocking the same poker face
Down to dance around the table like they own the place
(You look like you've seen a ghost.)
I got the whole world thinking it's a holiday
‘Cause they can smell the chum in the water from miles away
(You look like you've seen a ghost.)

[Chorus]
How alive? Too alive..
How alive? Too alive..
How alive? Too alive..
How alive? Too alive..
How alive? Too alive..
How alive? Too alive..
How alive? Too alive..
How alive? Too alive..

[Outro]
"Aesip Rock"
"Easep Rock"
"Easep Rock"
"Here's a bra"
"Say it really loud."
"Easep Rock"
"Easep Ro"
"Easeh Ro-Ro"
"Easeh-ehhhh Rock"</pre>
