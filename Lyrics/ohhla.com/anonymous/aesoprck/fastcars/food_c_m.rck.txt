"Fuck me!"

[Aesop Rock]
Two shoes chewed up, colluded with the feuds, rogue, veterans
Food, clothes, medicine
Wheeled it out the smoke stack factory trained to capture in the zoo's ghost predators
Food, clothes, medicine
I think I thunk a bunk colony could possibly amuse grown delegates
Food, clothes, medicine
Peace, the whipper-snapper generation greet 'em with a full blown pistol pull
Food, clothes, medicinal
Variety, for every plastic orange bottle
The tarnished pharmacy labels chafed in abrasive pockets
Suit the hell hounds with blades and chain lengths
For the dead walk a little less clumsy than you think
Hunger pain, chump change tell it to how his belly get
When bourgie hopes hellions,
Food, clothes, medicine, alumni,
Bum, I got the skin on the teeth between my fingertips and stellar
let's bet it melts together
Let's get these men some shelter
Three hots and a cot with Quaaludes
On a pillowcase left on an ultimately cordial gesture by the staff, (Staff)
it's a bath house for brave soldiers
When they coordinate to fornicating whores in maid's clothing
Sip a hot mocha, kick-up-chug up to the apple box,
Frankie says, "Relax", 20 says he snaps, safe wager,
Hell, 90 percent sensitive jubilee,
Never returned to brag about that fish bigger than you and me
Walk on glass, cruise cloaked residents
Bang on doors, food, clothes, medicine
United we stand to all our parties click,
I divide and conquer cause frankly I'd rather sit
We saw them rat races, machine or man, sprocket or fat laces
Hatchback of flashbacks from a heyday full of bad blazers
Now Major Aes route the following order
To all his crew's chromed generals,
Food, clothes, medicine.

Walk on glass, bang on doors,
Talk all trash, hang on whores
Walk on cash, bank on wars,
like food, clothes, medicine, it's yours
it's yours, it's yours, it's yours

[Aesop Rock]
We role tape protocol on a ring finger neighbor to peruse gross negligence
Food, clothes, medicine
Martyrs leak faster if the carver tweaks the dagger, 90 moves choked citizens
Food, clothes, medicine
Well y'at's a quick example accept as commitment's castle, cool, dope, excellent
Food, clothes, medicine
It's tough to legislate when scum tongue down a dinner plate of booze, coke, heroin
...
I'll bite the hand that feeds
Chew the steak and spit the knuckles back
Stitch 'em up and give em dap, before his brother's rubberneck
Iron chef Lithuania christen kitchen stadium
With chicken and mass serotonin drifting into gravy-dom
Save me some, scallywags hold your breath
The curmudgeon's gun dusty like the road to death
Bag a pin stripe my lizard kisser no kill switch,
Just a guilty gizzard wanna recommend a pill slip
I wipe placenta off my face in the height of the disco era
Cruise through liquid bubble gum, fever, death, and Christmas sweaters
Through juice saccharin fast food studied holdin' cliff's notes vendors
Now holds a bachelors in training ninjas to tip toe better
These are them sham city kidney kicks to the loose bolts
Belly ache-killins for claim who stand iffy on food, clothes, medicate
Pollywog, hug a spot lit with bigger lizards
In the land of hot milk and honey with stingers in it
Zinger!
Jimmy to jist up, check ya tip cup
Mother's watching babies near to preachers keen on fist fucks
Keep your schnoz clean, ears open, chopper zipped up!
Food, clothes, medicine, cause hungry, naked, sick, sucks!
Collide with worker ants, with autobahn inertia dance,
and curb them harp love bugs by the cursive final curtain clamp
Another savior with his foot, cold, stuck in his mouth
I played that who knows, food, clothes, fuck it, I'm out

Walk on glass, bang on doors,
Talk all trash, hang on whores
Walk on cash, bank on wars
like food, clothes, medicine, it's yours
it's yours, it's yours, it's yours
Food, clothes, medicine</pre>
