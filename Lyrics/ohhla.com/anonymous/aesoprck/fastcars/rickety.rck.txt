Artist: Aesop Rock f/ El-P, Camu Tao
Album:  Fast Cars, Danger, Fire & Knives
Song:   Rickety Rackety
Typed by: kill4747@hotmail.com

[Aesop Rock]
Smack dab in the middle of the cuddles and kills,
guerilla jimmy city limits with a bucket of pills
hollring 'no I don't immediately ameliorate 'em
I meet 'em, greet 'em, read 'em, and rate 'em, see if I hate 'em

[El-P]
Here come the hard rock bump through the speaker top
The tweeter meter blew code def hones in
I pack a lunchbox, walk to the stoning,
jump into the chemicals sold in my zoning
I'm irrational, paranoid, tragic
And the button on my chest says 'panic'
Punch it, hold up, don't touch me
I'm a savage from a rabid ass country

[Camu Tao]
Who want to get it?
You all acquitted
You need to quit it
Getting evicted, you little idiot, pitching tickets
It's sorta tricky the way you wanna go get your digits
Body you up at the party, somebody get his mistress

[Aesop Rock]
You take a pitch black lung and a purple heart,
then you kick back once the inertia start
And when the shipwreck sunk through the perfect dark,
the serpent's arch alerts every circled shark
See, bloody salt water sounds the h'ors d'oeuvres alarm,
and when the first arm's found we observe the art
Like a belly-acher won't kick face to the curb,
rather kick when the face already raped by the worms

[El-P]
Tasmanian pain coast, ridin'
Very little to say to these politician behind it, but this:
you better loosen the noose or lose livin'
These little kids walking the ave. quick to produce a biscuit

[Camu Tao]
Now you should medicate any area that the pain hits
And when you in the streets you should peep the sets of strangers
The actors that are in fact a cast of chaos
They be looking for any situation they can play on
Respectively injecting these thoughts, detain us
Negative speaking, they be creeping, they entertainers
When you out of data they run through a route that'll save ya
In retrospect, infect and pressing your papers

[El-P]
I design kill pain cave penmanship
Federal analog hog unedited
With a CUNY degree in young numbness
Angels on the rooftop, gun in they trumpets

[Aesop Rock]
I was buried to the neck in them all-start bloopers
Periscope down, hop Boss Hog cruiser
Porcelain or pewter authority wil be over ruled the second jukie uber alles news hit the sewers

[Chorus 2x: Camu Tao]
Rickety rackety
This city fit my style exactly
With a backspin, and the fat laces, Gazelle glasses, chase rap daily
Rickety Rackety, this city fit my style exactly
Near the train tracks, in the garbage bags, where the cement cracks, we a part of that
Rickety rackety, rickety rackety

[Camu Tao]
When you take 2 to the vein, introduce 2 to the brain
You don't get used to the pain. A maniac bruising the cage
When cats rush you in the public you be like 'do it again'
He's a motherfucking bloodsucker, he can do what he can

[El-P]
On the side of the block, do the bus stop
You paying a fare?
That's a trust fund.
Little ugly ass duck, life's a fun fuck
Too battered to rush, I walk punch drunk
And the whole world is yours now
Before the steppers are goosed kick your door down
I'm in the getaway whip with Aes Rizzle
He got the same shit stitched in his missles

[Aesop Rock]
Okay, lefty field..stealth
Dressed to kill..self
Megawatt with a horizontal neck spin swim funny to vertical bobble head yes men

[Camu Tao]
When the evil falls in it draws to the pours, it gnaws to the core
It's precedented that you represented a percentage
that wasn't vintage and the crawlers hate us
you automated, we brought the flavors, niggas you ought to hate us

[El-P]
And even from antagonity squad the family tissue
Testify the look of my eyes, genuine issue
I'm a freak in the flesh that penetrates lust
Spray the vaginal juices, like I was up in their undies

[Aesop Rock]
Don't picket the misfit law, Nancy
The core's no picnic
Mislead whores advancing
No business
Insist lured with candy to cure citizen x with that all-rours dancing
Corporals landing ashore, all soar boned nitwit, rickety rackety porn fancy
Weave through the hell and high water hot zone,
diseases in the minute the idiot got home

[Camu Tao]
Now I'm a teacher, first grade, and I want to participate
I want to grade the papers but I don't want to give them A's
Okay, F, D, F minus, test time, set timers
call every parent and give 'em a piece of my mind, shit
Cuz I don't want to give a good future, I'll shoot ya
Shoot ya?
With an uzi filled with rulers
Fuck minors, flush minds
Even leaving 'em bruised up
Stack kids, pack cute lunches in the cooler

[Chorus: Aesop Rock] + (Camu Tao) {El-P}
Rickety rackety
This city fit my style exactly
With a fireladder, with a wire scheduler, drink for the reek fish, smile after
(Rickety Rackety) {Rickety rackety}
(Rickety rackety, this pussy fit my dick exactly
With a threesome, giving three ?
Sex, drugs, girls, ?)
Rickety rackety, hold it!
{Rickety rackety}
