Artist: 2Pac
Album:  Greatest Hits
Song:   Troublesome '96
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Troublesome nigga 
Hahaha, troublesome 19-motherfuckin-96 (westside!)
Let it be known nigga
Boss of all bosses, Makaveli

[2Pac]
Menacin methods label me a lethal weapon
Makin niggaz die witnessin breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan
to be the man in this wicked land underhanded hits are planned
Scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Undercover agents die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my my heater
Got me a dog and named her my bitch nigga eater
What could they do to me and lil' brat?
Shit them niggaz that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside?
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggaz talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
Cause they fear me in physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
La la la la, la, la 
La, la-la la, lahhh
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggaz die

[2Pac over Chorus]
Troublesome nigga, Outlawz
Put it down to the fullest
Spittin rhymes and bullets, ha ha
We troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggaz run the streets, we troublesome

[2Pac]
Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
A guerilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor bet I bomb on the first niggaz
Knew we came for murder, pullin up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry bustin off freely
Screamin, "Fuck - ALL Y'ALL NIGGAZ" in Swahili
Pistol packin fresh out of jail, I ain't goin back
Release me to the care, of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass like an avalance
A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drivebys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin thoughts of my enemies pleadin please
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died;
cause I'm troublesome

[Chorus]

[2Pac over Chorus]
Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck
I'm hopeless - I live the Thug Life, losin my focus BA-BAY
I'm troublesome, haha
Bad Boy killa, there is no one realer
What you saw was the rough rugged and raw - Outlaw!

[2Pac]
Murder murder my mind state, shit ain't changed
since my last rhyme - the crime rate ain't decline
Niggaz bustin shots like they lost they mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen cause he yearned to bang
Sniffed a lot of flowers, but how could I cry
Tried to warn the little nigga either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep; I'm havin crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God to forgive me cause it's wrong but I plan to die
Either take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to hell cause I ain't beggin for my life
Ain't nuttin worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life;
I'm troublesome

[Chorus] - repeat to fade

[2Pac over Chorus]
In your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me
Hahahaha - I'm troublesome, I don't give a fuck
I'm troublesome.. like my nigga Napoleon said nigga
Somebody gotta explain why I ain't got shit
Ha ha, I'm troublesome
You know what time it is, the Outlaw clique
Young rugged and sick
Makaveli the Don the boss of all bosses
Musolini, Edi Amin, Hussein Fatal, Khadafi
Kastro, Napoleon, Bo Nitti
Ha ha, we ain't fuck around
We troublesome
Aiyyo, haha, we troublesome
I ain't goin.. HA HAH
Young Kastro, the first to blast the last one to dash
Goin for the hoes and the cash
Fuck you niggaz, Outlawz!  HA HAH
Khadafi - trump tight never sloppy
Them motherfuckers try to copy
but they can't mock you nigga, you're too strong
Outlawz keep it goin on, you know whassup
Outlawz, Outlawz, ha hah..
OUTLAWZ, OUTLAWZ
This is dedicated to the real niggaz
All the real troublesome soldiers on the streets

{.. bye bye, bye bye, all you niggaz die..}</pre>
