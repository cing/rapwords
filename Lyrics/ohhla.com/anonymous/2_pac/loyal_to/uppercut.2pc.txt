[Intro: Tupac Talking]
I wanted to bring back that reality
Nobody can ever be confused and think I'm fuckin Mike Tyson
And I'm the heavyweight champion, I'm a little nigga
That's why its so raw to just watch me battle lions
Cause I'm a little skinny nigga battlin' niggaz three times my size

Watch this uppercut, here it comes..
Watch the jab nigga...ugh...here it come
Look out, watch my arms..

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now see so many motherfuckers wanna take a peice
Commin' equipped with some shit that niggaz just can't believe
I pull a trick from my sleeve now kamikaze
I'm all over that nigga, come identify the body
My middle finger to you hoe niggaz
Run up on me, and I'll be forced to let it go nigga
I ain't the one you wanna try, why, stayin' high
I hit this blunt and watch these motherfuckers die
Whose runnin these streets I said that cocaine
Cause in the dope game, niggaz'll die 'fore they go broke mayne
Another hustler makin' major cash
'til the punk police come an raid ya ass
Now you stressed doin' fed time
and its a bitch 'cause the judge gave you 8 years
You doin 6 and we know that you can't hang
You a trick rolled over turned snitch like a biatchhhh

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
They got a nigga in the dice game
I'm feelin' lucky but the nigga just a little bigger
He tryin fuck me out my cash, ima blast nigga
He don't know I gotta tell ya like the last nigga
Gotta go don't need to roll for the truck, I get 'em up
Left to right, my uppercut'll hit 'em up (ha)
I'm known to walk the streets on any block
I love my niggaz, but I ain't puttin down my glock
The gun shots rang when I lose nigga, and ooh nigga
Ima show you not to ever play a true nigga (haha)
Lay it down just to prove it
And fuck the rappin motherfucker we can do this

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!

[Verse 3: E.D.I. and Young Noble of the Outlawz]
They claim that we violent, we named after tyrants
This revolution won't be televised, we keep it silent (shh)
Roll on our enemies, beat 'em at they own game
Molotov cocktails, release an up in flames
Tired of bein' stepped on, sick of bein' held back
Lookin' through my rear view, thinkin' bout the pay back
Wanna see my kids grow don't know if ima make it though
One more nigga came up short in the ghetto
Society lied to me so I'm strapped with the metal
Push ya middle finger up nigga if you a rebel
Have ya face down goin' in ya pockets if ya let em'
I done lost too many homies for me to ever forget em'
I done made so many mistakes but still I don't regret em'
I'm a product of the pimp, the pusher, and the reverend
I'm a product of the block, the fiends, and the felons
We all lost souls tryina find our way to heaven

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!

[Outro: E.D.I. Talking]
To all the comrads no longer with us, see you when we get there
'Pac, Yak, we gon' keep on ridin', give these cowards the uppercut
'Til we get up there with y'all, YOU KNOW!
Thug Life we still livin it
Outlaw for life, in the name of the Don, let's go!</pre>
