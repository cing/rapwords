Artist: 2Pac
Album:  Loyal to the Game
Song:   Out on Bail
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[2Pac]
Oh I posted bail?  I'm out this motherfucker?  I CAN GO?!
Aw FUCK Y'ALL!  Ay fuck the judge
Fuck the motherfuckin district attorney, the prosecutor
And fuck you motherfuckers in the jury box, FUCK ALL Y'ALL
Cause I'm out on motherfuckin bail
Y'all ain't NEVER gon' see me in this motherfucker again
Drop that shit Em
Let these ol' punk-ass bitches know how we runnin this shit
Niggaz ain't goin back to court, you STANK-ASS BITCHES

[Verse One]
I'm stuck in jail, the D.A.'s tryin to burn me
I'd be out on bail, if I had a good attorney
Want to label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up - I ain't trippin
In the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk cause I'm rappin, they askin me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson?
I can't sleep! They takin Polaroids
And I'm tryin to use the phone, but they makin noise
Man I wish I had my glock, cause it's major
I'm makin shanks out the plastic in razors
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone, that's my word
Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin murder
I'm makin co-llect calls to my ol' bitches
Send mo' pictures, and make me some mo' riches
To all the suckers on the block, talkin shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to get socked up
Cause the game is deep, and the fame is brief
And you bullshittin bitches ain't changin me
I came straight up out the gutter, I was saved from hell
And I'm a thug, I was raised in jail, now I'm out on bail

[Chorus]
(Out on bail) You know what fuckin time it is
I'm out on bail (thug life nigga) 50,000 BEYOTCH!  I'm out on bail
(Out on bail) Hand me some motherfuckin cold 40's in this bitch nigga
Cause I'm out on bail (thug life nigga)
Ay pass me my motherfuckin Rolex
Yes bitch, that's a Presidential

[Verse Two]
I'm stuck in jail, and mad as a bitch
I'd be out on bail, if it wasn't for the snitch
Runnin wild through the streets like I'm loco
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
I got no love in my heart cause I'm heartless
Mobbin in the park after dark when I start shit
Rippin up the scene as a teen I was at it, hey
And sellin product to the addicts cause they gotta have it
I was a well-known thug and I got a lot of love
Hangin out with the O.G.'s, shootin up the clubs
And momma told me, don't hang with the homies
But they got me if they need me, den it's ON G
Got me sittin in a cell, a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven?
Got my bitches on the outside, writin me letters
And they tell me they love me, and the shit'll get better
I don't believe 'em cause I just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your picture's on fire
I gotta be a player so I stay strong
Cause I know that I won't be away long
And when I finally do hit the fuckin streets, I'ma handle this
A thug nigga gettin scandalous, I'm on bail

[Chorus]
(Out on bail) (thug life, will never fail)
See, out on bail, beyotch! (thug life nigga)
Know what time it is (thug life nigga) I'm out on bail
(Out on bail) You know
Out on bail (thug life nigga) y'all know that shit
(thug life nigga) Get me up out this
Yo {?} get me up out this motherfucker baby

[Outro - repeat to end]
(Out on bail) (thug life, will never fail)
(thug life nigga) (thug life nigga)

[2Pac - over Outro]
Motherfuckers tryin, to harass a player
Man I ain't goin for this ol' crazy ol' shit
Dealin with you scandalous bitches
Y'all need to pop some of these crooked ass motherfuckin judges
But here go the motherfuckin bank, I'm out on bail
I'll see you motherfuckers at the next show
Get popped quick, Biggie is my bitch
You know, that's that ol' real thug shit
Real live thug shit, genuine
Y'knahmsayin?  I wouldn't waste yo' motherfuckin time with no bullshit baby
Trust me, it's that real shit
Talkin bout that shit you can be tellin your grandkids about y'know?
I ran with a thug nigga, believe that
This is for my fuckin nigga Em and the motherfuckin boys
In case you wonderin, we doin this shit, hell motherfuckin yeah
An ounce of that shit, sittin in yo' motherfuckin lap
Now press rewind nigga
