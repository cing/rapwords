[2Pac]
Now you've been actin like you want it for a long time
All up in a nigga face, givin me them strong vibes
Look in my eyes and you'll find peace
A gemini, so you really blow my mind freak, c'mon
I got my clothes off, hard as a nigga in jail
Skinny niggaz throw the dick well
Everybody get they condoms, brother cause it's time to fuck
Hurry up and put it on nigga, time is up
What's next got my mind on some group sex
Where you goin baby, I ain't even through yet
Do it like a true vet, love it how I threw it to ya
Even now make it good to ya, remember me?
I love fuckin slow with the lights low
Black puerto rican even white hoes, bellisimo
Que linda, dame beso, come to papi
Fuck until the shit is sloppy, if you really want it

[Eye] If you really want it
[Pac] Get'cha ass up; you know it, if you really want it
[Eye] If you really want it
[Pac] If, you really want it, if you really want it
If you really want it
[Eye] Uhh, uhh
[Pac] If you really want it

[2Pac]
Alright all my real niggaz and my real bitches
Let me see you do it like this, c'mon

[2Pac + Left Eye]
Rock, your body body, rock your body body
Rock, your body body, rock your body
Rock, your body body, rock your body body
Rock, your body body, we came to
Rock, your body body, rock your body body
Rock, your body body, rock your body
Rock, your body body, rock your body body
Rock, your body body..

[Left Eye]
Do you, you remember the time
when you absolutely, said never let it inside
Feel it's my duty, from gemini, to gemini
Can you imagine the trouble come bustin double, I'm much obliged
See I would love to go and take a ride
Have total leeway up and down your freeway, nothin to hide
If I was committed to suicide
I'd fuck around meet you now put it down, I'd testify
Ain't nobody here to understand the reason why
It's you and I, so everything is rectified
I know you tried, you even made a nigga cry
But love is blind, now can you stand the test of time?
Redefine, what it means to be an open mind
Feel the climax..
I bust a round for you, painted the perfect picture
I'm down for you, can't wait to get witcha
Rock, your body body, rock your body
Rock, your body body, rock your body

[2Pac]
Damn..
IF you really want it
You like that?  Yeah
If you really want it

[Left Eye]
Rock, your body body, rock your body
Rock, your body body, rock your body

[2Pac]
Don't hold back.. (?)
Yeah, yeah, I feel you

[2Pac]
Rock, your body body, rock your body body
Rock, your body body, rock your body body
Rock, your body body, rock your body body
Rock, your body body, we came to
Rock, your body body, rock your body body
Rock, your body body, rock your body
Rock, your body body, rock your body body
Rock, your body body..

[2Pac]
See, it all started simple, turned into me lickin the nipples
Fuckin you doggie style to this instrumental
Hands up, all up inside ya, hell I can stand ya
Eyes open I don't plan to bust, just hold on
Baby let me zone in, whaddyou mean?
Can you scream let it go beotch, how does it feel?
Got a nigga like steel in ya, to keep goin
Now I'm fuckin like I'm killin ya, let's go another round
Baby is you down really, two shots of ecstasy
Lick a nigga down silly, your body next to me
I could touch you inside, and you'll cry
So good when a nigga leave, you'll die
My mama told me baby be a man put it on her
Hittin bitches like, switches comin around the corner
I wanna let me get my ride on
It's yo' dick baby but it's my song, now if you really want it

[2Pac]
Gots to send this one out to the freaky bitches
Definitely all the scorpios, and the geminis, and the virgos
You know I know the truth about you scorpios and you virgos
No doubt gotta give it to the capricorns
They some freaks too on the down down
The libras, they like it even but they still like fuckin
No doubt, aquariuses, libras, I said those
Leos, yeah they some freaks, leos is freaks
They always wanna run shit in bed
Sagitarrius, taurus.. cancer, all you freaky fucks
I'm a zodiac fucker I'll do you all one at a time
And all day long, let's get busy!

[2Pac + Left Eye]
Rock, your body body, rock your body body
Rock, your body body, rock your body
Rock, your body body, rock your body body
Rock, your body body, we came to
Rock, your body body, rock your body body
Rock, your body body, rock your body
Rock, your body body, rock your body body
Rock, your body body..</pre>
