Nigga westside
Westside in this motherfucker
Westside in this motherfucker right here
Westside in this motherfucker
Westside in this motherfucker right here
Westside in this motherfucker
Westside in this motherfucker right here
Westside in this motherfucker

[2Pac]
Can't nobody stop us when we blunted up and swervin
Packed in a suburban, screamin outlaw runin on the curb
They never try me cause right behind me your killer team
I get a word cut the head off a nigga like a guillotine
This Hennessey'll keep me calm though
Sittin in the back of the club, tradin convo
Livin like a Don in my own mind
Signal Kadafi, nigga watch me with the chrome nine
All the time drinkin champagne
Walk through the crowd let the tramps hang
Niggas playa hate but do a damn thing
Picture me doin eighty down a one way
Stuck in the trunk, caught with gun play
So I gotta keep my eyes open
Gettin high, wonder why we gotta die smokin
My alibi, I'm victory
Like them other vile men I'm marked for death
Spendin my nights like its the last one left
I'm an outlaw

[Chorus]
Am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave, till I see everybodys gone
I'm at the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet swisher I'm the last one left
Tell me am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave until I see everybodys gone
I'm at the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet swisher, guess I'm the last one left

[Napoleon]
I got my back against the wall, gat chillin by my balls
Prior to war is rider nigga only five six tall
Napoleon only knows on we Outlawz, fuck fear
Better strap down to the fullest cause we out yeah
Thug Passion all up in me, feelin like I drunk some Henny
It ain't easy I'm tryin to make a dollar out of two pennies
War we got with these rap niggas, wanna pull they gat niggas
Only come outside cause they think 'Pac died nigga
Last niggas with our tec, ake a shot within our vest
'Pac come and catch wreck, nigga we the last ones left

[2Pac]
If we woulda known the zone inside my own dome
Fresh outta jail it was hell but I'm finally home
Lookin for niggas that was wolfin that shit when I was locked back
Hands on the pump, make 'em jump when it cocked back
Fuck 'em all, they bitches inside a world of weak
Bitch niggas be afraid to speak, we the last ones left

[2Pac]
[Chorus] (slight change)
Tell me am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave, till I see everybodys gone
At the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet swisher Like I'm the last one left
Am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave till I see everybodys gone
At the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet swisher, last one left
Am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave till I see everybodys gone
At the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor (Yeah)
Puffin on a sweet swisher, I'm the last one left

[Kastro]
I eat and sleep the worst shit, turfs and birth
Me and my team super supreme putin in work
I'm passed out, drunk as a fuck, till it hurt
And I call earl screamin fuck the world
I got a bitch on the side wanna be my wife
And wify beefin wanna know if she gonna see me tonight
And i know it aint right, but its the life I got
And thats until I see Yak
And thats until I see Pac
Young know I lost a troll somebody owed me down
And if the world was a girl I'd stick my dick in the ground
Fuck the world

[2Pac](Varied Hook)
