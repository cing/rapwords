Album:  Until the End of Time *
Song:   Until the End of Time
Typed by: ja_rule@lowrider.com

* - Chorus sung by RL on (Disc One), Richard Page on (Disc Two)

[2Pac]
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be - through the misery that came to pass 
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask - for currency
But you could run to me when you need and I'll never leave
Honestly, someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thang to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thang if he could
Cause in the hood true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin up call the cops
Bringin a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time 

[Chorus]
So take, these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time
Until the end of time

[2Pac]
Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all night, money making got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin solo, ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin 'Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homey had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin I'm a player I ain't sweatin him
I sex his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rappin the only thing I did good was scrappin
Until the end of time

[Chorus] - 2X

[2Pac]
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?
To live my life as an Outlaw all along
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end drinkin Heneessy made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminatin easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breath
While beggin me to keep the peace (haha)
What I can see closer to achieve
In times of danger don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the trainin to make a G
Remember me, as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about, more
Gettin raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time
