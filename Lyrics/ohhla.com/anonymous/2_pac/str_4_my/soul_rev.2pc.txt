Mr. Shakur, can you please explain the meaning
behind your violent lyrics?

[2Pac]
Explain the meaning?

* sounds of running and sirens in background *

[Kid]	Damn...
[Cop]	Police, FREEZE!
[Kid]	Can't get shit off!
[Cop]	I said FREEZE you miserable black son of a bitch!
[Kid]	What, come on, come on!

* gun shot * 

--> [Pac]:  Tupac Shakur as himself
--> [Soul]: Tupac Shakur as 'Souljah'

[Soul]	My attitude is shitty
	My message to the censorship committee
	Who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
[Pac]	The critics or the cops?
[Soul]	The courts or the crooks, don't look so confused
	Take a closer look
[Pac]	Niggaz get they neck broke daily
	Tryin to stay jail free
[Soul]	What the fuck does Quayle know
	of young black males?
[both]	Please tell me
[Soul]	Message to the censorship committee
	Who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
[Pac]	Huh, I pack a nine millimeter cause I got em livin hotter
	than the 4th of July, if I gotta die, I gotta
[Soul]	Momma told me, "Don't let em fade me..
	.. nigga don't let em make you crazy!"
	Game is what she gave me
[Pac]	Gotta watch your back, strapped
[Soul]	Real niggaz rat-pack
[Pac]	If you get your ass taxed, bring a gat back
	That's not the way we made it
[Soul]	That's just the way it is
[both]	Slangin rocks, in front of niggaz kids
[Pac]	I came up
	My message to the censorship committee
	Who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
	Cops pull me over, check my plates, but I'm legal
[Soul]	You couldn't get me, figure, "Fuck with a niggaz people"
[Pac]	They got me trapped, gat with the motherfuckin hammer back
[Soul]	Cops on my back, just cause I'm black, SNAP
[Pac]	Now I'm guilty?
	Message to the censorship committee
	Who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
[both]	All you punk police will never find peace 
	on the streets til the niggaz get a piece, fuck em!
[Soul]	They kill you to control ya
	(PAY) top dollar for your soul
[both]	Real niggaz don't fold, straight souljah!
[Pac]	Can't find peace on the streets
	til the niggaz get a piece, fuck police, hear them screamin
	Fuck em!  Can't find peace on the streets
	til the niggaz get a piece, fuck police, hear them screamin
(I hear ya!)
	Fuck em!  Can't find peace on the streets
	til the niggaz get a piece, fuck police, screamin
(I hear ya!)
	Fuck em!  Can't find peace on the streets
	til the niggaz get a piece, fuck police, screamin

	Fuck em!  Can't find peace on the streets
	til the niggaz get a piece, fuck police (I hear ya!)
	Fuck em!  Can't find peace on the streets
	til the niggaz get a piece, fuck police (I hear ya!)
	Fuck em!  Can't find peace on the streets
	til the niggaz get a piece, fuck police (I hear ya!)
	The niggaz scream fuck em!
[Soul]	Motherfuckin punk police (I hear ya!)
	Thinkin they run the motherfuckin streets
	It's mo' niggaz than it's police
	Think (I hear ya!)
	One nigga, teach two niggaz
	teach three niggaz, teach fo' niggaz (I hear ya!)
	teach mo' niggaz, and we could run this shit!
[both]	I hear ya!

"They finally pulled me over and I laughed
 Remember Rodney King and I blast on his punk ass" (I hear ya!)
