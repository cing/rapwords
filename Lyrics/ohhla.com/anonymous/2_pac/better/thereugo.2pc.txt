Artist: 2Pac f/ Big Syke, Jazze Pha, Outlawz
Album:  Better Dayz (Disc Two)
Song:   There U Go
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[2Pac] I don't know why I be fuckin witchu

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggaz tryin to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin, what am I tryin for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
a lil', trick on a mission tryin to get in my P's
Me and my niggaz is thug niggaz, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggaz
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a hoe into a housewife, baby, and there you go

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Baby there you go, actin like a hoe
There you there you go, actin like a hoe
Baby there you go, actin like a hoe
Actin like a hoe, actin like a hoe
HOE!  See the word on the streets you're a
HOE!  Just a groupie on a world tour
HOE!  Now I found out for myself you're a
HOE!  Girl you need to check yourself

[Verse Two: Kastro]
These silly bitches got this game twisted
So I don't claim 'em, just bang 'em
Papa raised a player, so player, I play 'em
I got hoes that got more, hoes than me
So how I look, gettin hooked, like I ain't got G?
Truly cutie booty big, but that ain't enough
And the head make me beg, still that just ain't enough
when I don't trust her, the bitch be lyin too much
When she be dyin to fuck me you be buyin her stuff, hoe

[Verse Three: Kadafi]
See girlfriend I know, your whole M.O.'s preoccupied with mostly
gettin clown after clown, town coast to coast - see
I been tryin to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump yo' aim, straight through them spandex, don't front
Just name, spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game
I keep flowin like H20 it ain't nuthin for me to say
Why you keep actin like a hoe?  But there you go

[Chorus]

[Verse Four: Young Noble]
Uhh, when I first met her I told her I was busy all the time
Now she, callin me flippin like she miss me all the time
How she, don't even trip she got a man at home
You need to stop chasin dick bitch and raise your son
I'm like - damn, we can creep sometime
And you know I'm on the road for like weeks at a time
Girl you're thirsty; and stop callin while I'm workin you hurtin me
All this bullshit is irkin me girl, but there you go

[Verse Five: Big Syke - last few words of each line repeat]
I blame it on yo' momma, she need to holla at you
But should I blame it on yo' daddy for all the things that you do
Cause there you go, just like a hoe, caught in the streets
Like givin yo' number out to every nigga you meet
I'm tired of the games you playin, so stop playin (hoe)
You hear what I'm sayin, you only good for parlayin
I'm layin down the rules, this a game that you lose
So the streets can have you baby cause I stay on the move
(There you goooo)

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Outro: 2Pac]
There you go baby girl, THAT'S the story
There you MOTHERFUCKIN go
I coulda SWORE you told me you was gon' change
And you don't wanna go to clubs no more and
You wasn't fin' to dress all crazy no more and
You was gon' stay home and try to chill
What happened baby?
Ohh, so yo' FRIEND wanted to go out
That wasn't you that went out
You was just goin out cause yo' friend was
Okay, so you was pissy drunk up in that nigga car
cause yo' FRIEND wanted to get drunk huh?
It's all good, cause there you go baby
Oh I ain't trippin on them niggaz callin the house
It's all good, cause there you go
Me I'ma still be a player, all day baby
So uhh, there you go

[Chorus] - fades out</pre>
