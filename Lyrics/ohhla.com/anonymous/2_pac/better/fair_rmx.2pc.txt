Album:  Better Dayz (Disc Two)
Song:   Fair Xchange (Remix)
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro: Mya]
Nooooo, nooooooo...

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Picture of perfection, the object of a nigga affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Pushin permanent twistin I'm on a mission got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screamin when I did
Steady yellin out spots for me to hit, and aww shit
Soon as I seen her saw us playin hide the weiner
Wanna "Freak Like Me," fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holla out my name when a thug nigga ride, can I come inside
Say you don't feel it that's a lie, you just scared to get this
penitentiary dick, the trot caught your eye
when I walked by, I said, "Hi"
But you was so shy, I can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it and even worse
Got your heart set on me goin first, and that ain't no fair exchange

[Chorus: Mya]
Only one thing that you, can do, for me
Baby you can treat me right, we can do it every night
Nothin more than a fair exchange
Hit my G-spot and make, me scream, your name
If you can get with me you won't, I got what I want and gone
Nothin more than a fair exchange

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Open your legs
Got me watchin like it's a million, you tremble from the feelin
Look up, cause I got mirrors on the ceiling
And if you willin, then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I betchu I can make you cum sixty-one times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw yo' legs out the window
Remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me?  "I Get Around," and I'm haunted by my temptations
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it cause you walk around actin like you perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Bitch you ain't doin me no favors, fair exchange

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Now yo' attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true I'm gettin pussy, but baby you gettin dick!
And since you bein laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of fakin like you can't hear the bed shakin
In bed naked you so twisted think yo' legs breakin
You said take it so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last?
Doggie style steady pumpin on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
Cause you actin like you did somethin, givin me a piece
I had you mufflin your screams in the sheets, fuckin with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustlin bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange

[Chorus] - repeat 2X (w/ ad libs)

[Mya]
Fair exchange
No one, gives me lovin (lovin)
Quite like you do (No one gives me lovin like you do)
No one, gives me lovin
Quite like you do (Nigga I knows you know you love our love)
(The things that I'ma do, to you..)</pre>
