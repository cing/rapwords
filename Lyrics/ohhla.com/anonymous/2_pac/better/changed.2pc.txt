Artist: 2Pac f/ Johnta' Austin, T.I.
Album:  Better Dayz (Disc One)
Song:   Changed Man
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[2Pac]
Shit, I'm a changed man
Ay, turn the lights out
Big baller 2Pac up in this bitch
Y'know how we swing this shit, look

[Verse One: 2Pac]
By age sixteen I sold to dopefiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gunsmoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuckin diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggaz trippin homey, when we ridin?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M.O.B.
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a baller cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
The gameplan of a changed man, so what I'm sayin is

[Chorus: Johnta' Austin] + (2Pac)
I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(Fuckin with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin with a changed man)
All my real thug niggaz, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin with a changed man

[Verse Two: T.I.]
In drop top, the glock cocked, got rocks in my socks
Cops spot Watt niggaz but hardly stop niggaz
Not if they got niggaz, doughboys and hot niggaz
Who mighta shot niggaz but only by strugglin
I'm for respect nowadays they expect me
to be in a Ferrari or the old SL
Or anything you see flashin past and can't catch
Dat's me, gauge on the Escalade back seat - don't creep
Oh what you think, T.I., P and them sweet?  (Don't sleep)
Get you hit from your head to your feet  (And you don't know me)
I'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me
You walk in, exploded and leave reload
You don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me
But you will respect me or get it in your neckpiece G
No three niggaz here are gonna let me be
or get you inside there's codes to the streets nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: 2Pac]
A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin through coastin
Who's that nigga in the G-ride screamin out
M.O.B.!  Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
#1 in the nation
I fucked the world, the Judge gave me probation
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin to the whole nation
GIMME MINE, or I'm blastin on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggaz
And fuck a bitch, cause a true sister love niggaz
Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the massive smoke, on Death Row
My adversaries BLEED
But fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease, fuckin with a changed man

[Chorus]

[Chorus] w/ 2Pac speaking over it

[2Pac]
E'rybody think they understand me
Shit, you niggaz don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap song
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3-D
Real live right up against you in front of yo' face
Shit, nigga you fuckin with a changed man

[Outro: 2Pac]
Westside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe
You fuckin with a changed man
Hahaha.. you fuckin with a changed man
Hahaha.. I ain't the same, you fuckin with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fuckin with a changed man
We ain't the same, fuckin with a changed man
Changed man</pre>
