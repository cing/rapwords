Artist: 2Pac f/ Outlawz
Album:  Better Dayz (Disc One)
Song:   Never B Peace
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Now of course I want peace on the streets, but realistically
Paintin perfect pictures ain't never worked, my misery
was so deep, couldn't sleep through all my pressures
In my quest for cash I learned fast, usin violent measures
Memories of adolescent years, there was unity
But after puberty we brought war, to our community
So many bodies droppin it's gotta stop, I wanna help
But still I'm steppin, keep my weapon, must protect myself
The promise of a better tomorrow, ain't never reached me
Plus my teachers was too petrified in class to teach me
Sippin Thunderbird and grape Kool-Aid, callin earl
Since my stomach was empty it seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my lil' homies lose they childhoods to guns
Nobody cries no more, cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace, if you can't grant it
Niggaz fightin 'cross the whole planet, so it could never be peace

[First Chorus: 2Pac]
Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know - there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there could never be peace

[Verse Two: Kastro]
Somebody owes me - will they control me?  Not
I ain't a hater player but I want all you got
Y'all babies had babies now we fightin each other
My dawgs got rabies, they bitin each other
And it ain't hard to find a friend like mine
Bigfully is a bullet and he don't mind dyin
And I gotta be blind, missed sign after sign
Time after time, after time after time
And I don't like nobody, they don't like me more
And I'm good with that finally but it heard it before
Dawg, we livin in a prison, losin our religion
On, Thanksgiving we thankful, just for livin in Hell
Damn homey, I don't mean to be harsh
But there's a Devil in the ghetto tryin to tear it apart
And if we make it up out, we still stuck in the dark
Will there ever be peace?  Just a piece of my heart
Never

[Interlude: Outlawz]
The only peace, we got, is a piece of our heart
Piece of our mind, or that damn piece, that we hold in our waistline
You feel me dawg?  C'mon, uhh

[Middle Chorus: 2Pac]
So will there ever be peace, or are we all just
headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know - there'll never be peace (never)
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there'll never be peace

[Verse Three: Napolean]
Thangs is changin, nigga you better read the signs
I'm only concerned about me and mine in these times
The world is a ghetto and peace is not a part of it
We all believe God's new plan to make it out of this
Niggaz spendin too much time hatin on each other
Niggaz buyin guns, loadin 'em up, aimin at each other
And the victim is you and me, it's sick but it's true indeed
The GOOd Die, Mostly Over Bullshit, repeatedly
Deep in me there's a part that wants nothin but love
But the rest of me know, war is what's waitin for us
So I stays ready, keep my pay heavy and boss up
Stack my funds and my guns, never rely on luck
Askin God to point out the imposter
Never let no weapon formed against me prosper
Cause there'll never be peace, so don't rely on it
Soldiers dyin for it - and in the ghetto, they cryin for it
But fuck peace!

[Final Chorus: 2Pac]
Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know - there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Fool, there'll never be peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know - there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Nigga there'll never be peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know - there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walks the streets
Nigga there'll never be peace

[Outro: 2Pac]
Will there ever be peace?
.. Shit, fuck peace!
On the strength 'til my niggaz get a piece, we can't have peace
How the fuck we gon' live happy when we ain't got nuttin?
You muh'fuckers are smilin but I'm mean muggin
Why, cause I GOTTA be thuggin
It seems drugs done turned this whole motherfuckin hood out
All us niggaz actin up, wild-ass motherfuckin adolescents
These niggaz ain't even got no childhoods no more
How the fuck can you have a childhood
and you at the funeral every muh'fuckin weekend?
Pssh, and you muh'fuckers talkin about peace
Nigga, it ain't no motherfuckin peace
You ain't seen the news motherfucker?  You ain't heard?
Lil' babies gettin smoked, muh'fuckers killin they whole family
Lil' kids gettin thrown off buildings, muh'fuckers gettin abused
Peace?  Nigga is you out your fuckin mind?
Fuck peace!  We can't never have peace
'til you motherfuckers clean up this mess you made
'Til you fuckin clean up the dirt you dropped
'Til we get a piece, fuck peace!  Westside</pre>
