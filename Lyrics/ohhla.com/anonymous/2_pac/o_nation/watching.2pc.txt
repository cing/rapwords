[Intro: Tupac Talking]
Bitches be paranoid looking at a nigga all crazy 
I'm just looking, SHIT!
I'm just looking baby, ha ha ha

[Kurupt] All I need is some Henni'

[Verse One: Tupac]
To me it's hard to tell what you really want
Quit acting mean to me, you're teasing me the way you flaunt
But you ain't hearing me, sincerely, I'm so attracted 
Pictures of target practice making love on my mattress 
Visions getting graphic
So realistically you could grab it, it's a proven fact
Baby gotta have it, my love making quite magic
Tricks is for kids bunny rabbit, let a man have it
But you'd be satisfied if you tried my habit
High performance, hard to handle
Thinking in the bubble bath while I'm burning candles
Sex me like the slow song
If fucking you was bad baby then I'm so wrong
My feeling is so strong
I keep starring like you can't see me
I never planned to scam my thoughts ran freely
There is no need to be paranoid, ain't nothing popping
I ain't worried about your man baby girl cause I'm just watching

[Chorus:] 
[Snoop:] WATCHING!!
[Wilson] Just watching
[Kurupt] JUST WATCHING!!
[Wilson] Not buying anything
[Tupac:] You know, I ain't worried about your man baby girl, I'm just watching
[Wilson] Just watching
[Kurupt] JUST WATCHING!!
[Wilson] Not buying anything
[Snoop:] Baby girl, baby girl, do you wanna go to my place?
[Wilson] Just watching
[Kurupt] JUST WATCHING!!
[Wilson] Not buying anything 
[Kurupt] For real, this is how we do it, what's up Dogg?

[Verse Two: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
You know what? - You know what?
I'm taking trips to Convo, with my Death Row family
We're out on the road, we're sporting Diamonds and Gold
We're pushing Yachts and Jet Skis, smoking on hell of weed
We're trying to have millions man, y'all can have them Gs
Bitches flocking up eying nothing, all about them papers
We're standing away from the player-haters and the impersonators
But we're sporting Gators and we don't cater to no whore 
From San Diego to Vallejo and all the way down to Idaho
You know, you wonder why this game don't change
They say you gotta have a way from the very start
So when I step into a club like Magic Cities
They be greedy with passion and the whole Atlantic city
And pull up to a seed that had never sparked
And post up, just like the Double R
Don't get mad; cause a nigga ain't spent shit
I'm just watching it and besides I'm a pimp, bitch!

[Chorus:] 
[Wilson] Just watching
[Kurupt] JUST WATCHING!!
[Wilson] Not buying anything
[Tupac:] You know..
[Wilson] Just watching
[Kurupt] JUST WATCHING!!
[Wilson] Not buying anything yeahhh!
[Kurupt] I ain't buying shit
[Wilson] Just watching
[Kurupt] JUST WATCHING!!
[Wilson] Not buying anything 
[Kurupt] That nigga Daz
[Wilson] Oohh baby, yeah

[Verse Three: Daz Dillinger]
Now tell me how you feel about me, the whole world know about me
Don't doubt me, you got me hardship, your pussy all on my dick
I sleep with Dubs down your drawers
Take it from my dogs, where your ass be at, bitches all their ass
Shaking asses and titties but you they say don't touch
I wanna fuck, that's all I wanna do to suck
All in the guts (What's up?) quick and fast
Watching and clocking, ain't no stopping when the music popping
Homie having fun with no gun (Ha ha What's up baby?)
Death Row got the party off the hook
I take the Chronic, I take a book (What up Kurupt?)

[Verse Four: Kurupt]
As soon as my eyes open, the first thing hits
Me and the homies on the strip, fuck around with some Swiss
As soon as I hit the corner I'm on ya, eyes on scope
I'm about to soothe on my way to see Daz, 'Pac and Snoop
There's something cute about five foot six
And no sweat, I'm on set for the triple double twist
That's why I trip, I got to clear my mind
Take a couple hits of this bomb
Nate Dogg hit the switch to say fuck you bitch
Cause if I spent I'm taking two pussy, I just wanna fuck
Even though deep down I know she got some bomb ass pussy
So what would you do? roll, pass and just stop
Or coast up on the corner like a dog and just watch
WATCH!! WATCH!! WATCH!! WATCH!! WATCH!! (Watch out!)
 
[Chorus:] 
[Wilson] Just watching
[Kurupt] JUST WATCHING!!
[Wilson] Not buying anything
[Kurupt] It's a Dogg Pound Thing
[Wilson] I'm not buying you anything yeah!!
[Wilson] Just watching
[Kurupt] JUST WATCHING!!
[Wilson] Not buying anything
[Kurupt] It's a Thug Life Thing, Thug Life!
[Wilson] I'm not buying anything
[Wilson] Just watching
[Kurupt] JUST WATCHING!!
[Wilson] Not buying anything yeahhh!
[Tupac:] You, rat house bitches
[Wilson] Just watching
[SnoopD] Straight Up!!
[Wilson] Not buying anything ooohhh!
[Wilson] Just watching
[SnoopD] Just like a player
[Wilson] Not buying anything
[SnoopD] Strictly for the players

[Charlie Wilson] Just watching, not buying anything
[Snoop Doggy Do] I'm just watching, just watching, just watching
[Charlie Wilson] Just watching, not buying anything
[Snoop Doggy Do] Ummmm, just peeping out the window, watching, just watching</pre>
