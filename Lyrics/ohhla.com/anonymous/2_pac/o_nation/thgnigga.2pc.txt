[Intro]
[Capit] Yo E, somebody come in this motherfucker with me man
[Tupac] I'm with you nigga, you don't need nobody, I'm with you nigga
[Capit] Come on nigga what's up?
[Tupac] L.S. and Pac, Greg Nice
[Capit] You're looking at me through the window
[Tupac] Asu, set it off with you nigga
[Capit] Come up in here with me y'all
[Tupac] Set it off nigga, for the niggaz in new York
[Capit] Yo ha ha ha, ha, ha, ha (Westside nigga) Yo yo
[Tupac] L.S in this bitch
[Capit] We're in the motherfucking West Coast right now
[Tupac] West side!!
[Capit] Word to mother
[Tupac] Eastside
[Capit] My nigga Kurupt, K-Kurupt word, I got my nigga Greg Nice
[Tupac] Right there nigga, right there
[Capit] Baby Jesus and the All Stars
[Tupac] Baby Jesus
[Capit] And Tha Outlawz, taking off the draws, you niggaz floss
        Yo we're about to, yo check it out

[Verse One: Capital L.S.]
What does it take to shake and bake nowadays?
Niggaz in crime, get net cause it pays
Bodies get sprayed with motherfucking Ultra-rays
When shit gets too smooth I get's, rude with the lipper
Any kind of Liquor's Company like Jack Tripper
There's been times when I flip like acrobats
Fucking Coast to Coast, chickenheads to hoodrats
Tools to Gats, Lowriders to Act's
Two years ago my shit was underrated
I wish you rap niggaz frustrated
The rhyme stated updated; as I migrated
I'm direct from Strong Island, New York
Where I be smiling, profiling, wilding
With my niggaz in the Acura Coupe
In the Ja's and bitches like the Ginseng group
Playing that "One Love" loop Ha ha ha
The sun shines through my sunroof
Some days I can amaze the youth with proof that
The force of my rhyme can cause a cardiac
Arresting motherfuckers that don't like investing
So I eat them up like salad dressing
And it don't stop

[Break: Tupac]
Ha ha ha, yeah nigga, that's how we do that shit
L.S. in this bitch, nigga that's how we do that shit
Niggaz can't stand this, no doubt, no doubt
My scandalous family, insanity
It ain't no playing nigga we're taking over the whole industry
You bitch made niggaz can't believe that shit
L.S. and niggaz so crazy
You only have to pay, to pull up on that bitch
You've been clowned, to make it to that ground
These niggaz snatching your business kid

[Verse Two: Asu]
They fucked around and let the Turk bred up out the stable
Me and my Cali' niggaz is jumping fools without the cables
Everything I got is double two's, four's and barrels
Once that ass slip, we got's to burn it, like Caro'
Somehow, someway, real niggaz know real niggaz ya-yo why is that?
When you roll Asu, you end up with them tires flat
The names Asu, it starts with A and ends with U
Whatever you want to do, I got my whole fucking crew
Up over the mountain there's fountain of phrases
I'm counting pages, ages is giving up wages to heal the rages
I don't riff, I stay cool let the sanity build
All I need is a starter and the horror that's worse than Amityville
No disrespect, all we want is bacon G
Pack them bags; they have them hotel got vacancies

[Break: Tupac]
Get the fuck and stop this tray nigga, peep that shit
Til their motherfucking chin checking, we're wrecking
Look here

[Verse Three: Tupac]
My niggaz crooked though it seems
My every single thought is caught up in collecting cream
A made nigga; picture me dying in a blaze of gun fire
Will not retire til I'm paid, turn the base up higher
When we ride, we fly by, bitches blow me kisses
Niggaz from Compton to Brooklyn come on get your riches
From Crenshaw to 125, and Do or Die
Rolling with niggaz from Long Beach to Long Isl'
I hardly smile cause my heart froze
Once I; commence my show rip apart foes
And now I, got One Nation it's a crooked compilation
Just to end the bullshit, let's get back to money making
Tell them busters that I rolled on controlling the house
My shit is so wicked when I flip, niggaz closing their mouth
The Cocoa Brovaz, Buckshot the BDI Thug
Greg Nice, L.S., Asu, so show a nigga love, Outlaw!

[Outro: Tupac]
You can feel that shit nigga!
You know what time it is, ha ha ha ha, yeah!
Hit them niggaz with the shit that made Nice & Smooth nice nigga
Greg Nice feel me nigga?
I know she fucked a lot of drug dealers
But she never got fucked by a thug nigga
Come on! I know she fucked a lot of drug dealers
But she never got fucked by a thug nigga
Come on! I know you fuck a lot of drug dealers
But you never got fucked by a thug nigga, baby never
Come on! I know you're fucking with some drug dealers
But you never got fucked by a thug nigga
Ha ha ha ha, yeah yeah!, all like that nigga
Ha ha ha ha, hell motherfucking yeah, Thug Life baby
It don't stop, this song is twisted and crazy
Yeah nigga, that nigga Tupac
From this block to your block, you can tell the kids nod
One Nation, fuck around and get shot, you know, One Nation
East side, West Side, ha ha ha ha, yeah
All my niggaz on the East Side, throw up your guns
All my niggaz on the West Side, throw up your guns
All my niggaz from the East Side, throw up your guns
All my niggaz from the West Side, throw your guns up
Niggaz from the East Side, throw up your guns
All my niggaz from the West Side, throw your guns up
