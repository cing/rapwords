Young Thugs in this motherfucker
Don't break up the fight, let 'em rumble
Don't make enemies with me
I Try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me

Some say my criminal experience is legendary
I do what's necessary
Niggas wanna see me burried
Worried, if you coming hurried
I ain't going down, fuck the world I'm a thug
Tell 'em can't nothing stop me but a slug
I went from drug dealing to a shot caller
From off the block, no longer rock
And putting money in my pocket, nationwide baller
Bitch nigga I'm prepared to die, Before I fry
I hit the weed so I be forever high
My eyes has seen so much in misery, So before I flee
I open fire let the lord pick the first to bleed
Bitches don't wanna see me leave, forever thugging
Tell 'em bury me a G on everything I love
And fuck the law 'cause the raw niggas ain't free
This picture's clear but we can't see, hahaha
This game is jealousy, Don't let 'em change
That's what they keep on telling me, motherfuck the fame
I can't sleep 'cause I keep hearing peeps
loaded Mossberg wrapped in my sheets

Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
Rather fuck with these other other little Gs
Don't make enemies with me, nigga
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
Fuck with these other other little Gs
Don't make enemies with me

Mutah with K-Dogg in ()
-----------------------
The game is getting deeper with this I couldn't stop, I'm reminising
And having flashbacks when them niggas came up missing
(Wish in my heart, these niggas they ain't have to start
Now therefore they gotta see in dark
Played the part with heart when we spark they part
Running silly through the court) They don't really wanna start
(How you wanna do?) Yo K, anyway
These motherfuckers wanna play we can do it all day
So I stay (Sipping on my aray to keep my head fine
And I'm where? Everywhere from here to bedtime) <yeah nigga>
And I squeeze when I say I'm coming
Straight gunning on enemies if it's really me that they wanting
(Cause it ain't nothing, Y'all niggas is fronting
Do you really want it?   niggas dying...)

Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
You'd rather fuck with these other other little Gs
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
You'd rather fuck with these other other little Gs
Don't make enemies with me

Big Mal with Yak in ()
----------------------
Now, we're in '94, Niggas get bust through the do'
?Cup? in a flash sittin on that ass (And rarely fold)
Galitter tell 'em bout that trife shit (You wanna fight?
I wanna light shit, you lose your life bitch) <bee-yatch!>
A nigga struggle too hard for what I got
hustle (And doubled every fucking yard that I cop and stop
Hell nah! I coulnd't see it
Facing a century in the penatentury but so be it)
And Jesus couldn't help me out the state
(Prepare for an early date to see my fate at the pearly gate
But wait) No time for stalling (But death is calling)
You wanna stomp on it somebody's gotta start falling
(True, what I do from sun up) is for a come up
(Wake up with my gun up) Cause when I sneak that's when they run up
(So It's time to spray like Ray
And put the freeze on these fake Gs)  You know how we do
