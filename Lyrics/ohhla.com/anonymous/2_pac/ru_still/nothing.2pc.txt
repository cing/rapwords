Artist: 2Pac
Album:  R U Still Down? (Remember Me)
Song:   Nothing to Lose
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[2Pac]
The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out
Stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out
Pray to my God everyday, but he don't listen
The poverty bothers me; but mama's workin wonders in the kitchen
Listen I can hear her cryin in the bedroom
Prayin for money but never think would she be dead soon
Am I wrong - for wishin I was somewhere else
I'm thirteen, can't feed myself
Can I blame daddy 'cause he left me; wish he would've helped me
Too much like him, so my mama don't love me
On my own at a early age - I'm gettin paid
and I'm strapped so I'll never be afraid
Where did I go astray? I'm hangin in the back streets
runnin with G's and dopefiends will they jack me?
Can't turn back, my eyes on the prize
I got nothin to lose, everybody gotta die
Say good-bye to the - bad guy
that one you fucked when you passed by
Buck buck (*gunshots*) from a Glock let the glass fly
Do or die walk a mile in my shoes
And you'd be crazy too 

[Chorus]
with nothin to lose, got nothin to lose
"That's why I got gang related rhymes" -> Ice Cube
Got nothin to lose, got nothin to lose
"That's why I got gang related rhymes" -> Ice Cube
Got nothin to lose, got nothin to lose
"That's why I got gang related rhymes" -> Ice Cube
Got nothin to lose, got nothin to lose
"That's why I got gang related rhymes" -> Ice Cube

[2Pac]
I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though I'm stressin keep a vest for protection
from the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggaz in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nothin seperatin us from a mack 10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older
Straight soldier, buckin at them bustaz
No matter how you try niggaz never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
See me strikin down the block hittin co'ners
Mobbin like a motherfucker livin like I wanna
Ain't no stoppin at the red lights - I'm sideways
Thug Life motherfucker criiime pays
Let the cops put they lights on - chase me nigga
Zig-zaggin through the freeway - race me nigga
In a high speed chase with the law 
The realest motherfucker that you ever saw, I'm livin raw 
'til they bury me don't worry me, I'm high
Livin like I ain't afraid to die (hahaha)
And you could walk a mile in my shoes
and you'd be crazy too

[Chorus]

[2Pac]
Ain't no escape from a deadly fate
And everyday there's a million black bodies put away
I'm startin' to lose hope; it seems everybody's on dope
Mama told me to leave cause she was broke
Sometimes I choke on the indo, creepin out the window
Alone on my own I'm a criminal
Got no love from the household, I'm out cold
On the streets screamin motherfuckin peace
I got nothin to lose, and somethin to prove, what do I do?
Live the Thug Life nigga stay true
I wonder when they, kill me, is there a Heaven for a real G
Lord forgive me if you feel me
Cause all my life I was dirt broke, with no hope
Lil' skinny motherfucker wantin dough
I hated cuttin suckers with my razor blade
but everyday it's a struggle to get major paid
Anyway it's so hard on a nigga in this city, no pity
And ain't no love for the scrubs that be buyin dubs
If you could walk a mile in my shoes you'd be crazy too

[Chorus]

[2Pac]
They wonder what type nigga be a - Thug Life nigga
We be the craziest... motherfucker! You know!
They wonder what type nigga be a Thug Life, nigga
We be the craziest!</pre>
