Album:  Hit 'Em Up II
Song:   4 My Niggaz
Typed by: dy_face@yahoo.com

[Intro: Tupac]
Ha Ha, that's right, alright
Storm motherfuckers ain't really knowing; 
If you can flow or not, so do this shit like last time

[Tupac]
Holler my name nigga, you're riding to scream
Must be a thug with a heart, to be a part of my team
It seems we got a problem, we ain't letting no women
And the feminine side, has been denied 
Time to give them a try

[Storm]
Finally made it, now focus who the dopiest?
Is it the brothers or the sisters
I agree it's a man's world; but why must niggaz dis us?
I ain't trying to hear it, witness my thug spirit
[Tupac] They keep on screaming bitches
Cause niggaz love to hear it
Called on my Dawgs cause they're rowdy then a motherfucker
I love you niggaz like brothers (Ha ha ha) but don't fuck with me

[Tupac]
Oh! bad now? - look at what we got
Miss Billy Bad-ass running around packing double Glocks 
HUH! so all you niggaz be warned
From the dusk til the dawn
We might trip but I dare you tricks to fuck around with Storm
We Outlawz, I said it and meant it
And when you see my live on TV, it's strictly represented
Now let me hear you scream

[Chorus #1: Tupac]
This is for my niggaz, only for my niggaz
For my niggaz, let me see you throw your hands up

[Chorus #2: Storm]
This is for my sisters, only for my sisters
For my sisters, let me see you throw your hands up

[Tupac]
Now when I say Pig; you say B.I.G.
When I say Bad Boy killer, then you say ME
When I say Puffy is a punk, you scream word on my life
I wrote this shit while fucking Big's wife

[Storm] 
Now I been told that Lil Kim thinks she hot (She not)
Better get that attitude adjusted before I mash your spot
[Tupac] Plus now Da Brats tripping
Must want an ass-whipping
We be the first ones to fuck with you
And Bad Boy whack bitch

[Tupac]
Busting through Brooklyn, licking my shots to Queens
Cause I'm looking for Little Shawn, that bitch ass fiend
I made him scream like last year
Best don't come to California, we don't want your buster ass here

[Storm]
We're Outlaw riders, thugs til we die
Sisters get their groove on, niggaz getting high

[Tupac]
Call me a motherfucking troublemaker
Send me to jail, but watch me bust on L.L.
Now let me hear you scream

[Chorus #1: Tupac] 3X

[Chorus #2: Storm] 3X

[Tupac]
Oh! yeah, it's like that? check it
This is for the riders, only for the riders
For the riders, let me see you throw your hands up

[Storm]
This is for the riders, only for the riders
For the riders, let me see you throw your hands up

[Tupac]
It's like that? check it
This is for the bitches, only for the bitches
For the bitches, let me see you throw your hands up

[Storm]
This is for them busters, only for them busters
For them busters, let me see you throw your hands up

[2Pac]
Ha ha ha, that's right
This is for my niggaz, only for my sisters
For my riders, let me see you throw your hands up

[Outro: Tupac]
Ha Ha ha, out-kicked your ass, didn't I?
We're up out here, word!
We're Tupac and Storm (Right)
Outlaw Immortals
Mash out on Death Row, West Side 
Thug life, West Side bitch
Bad Boy killers, nothing can fill us</pre>
