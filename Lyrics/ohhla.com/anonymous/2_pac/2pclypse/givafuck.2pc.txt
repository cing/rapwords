Artist: 2Pac
Album:  2Pacalypse Now
Song:   I Don't Give a Fuck
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ FLash

[19 second phone call intro]

[Verse One: 2Pac]
I don't give a FUCK!!
They done pushed me to my limit, I'm allll in
I might blow up any minute, did it again
And ow I'm in the back of the paddy wagon
While this cop's braggin about the nigga he's jackin
I see no justice - all I see is niggaz dying fast
The sound of a gun blast, then watch the hearse - pass
Just another day in the life 'G'
Gotta step lightly cuz cops tried to snipe me
The catch, they don't wanna stop at the brother man
But then they'll have an accident and pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my check
I get more respect from the motherfuckin' dope man
The Grammy's and American music shows
They pimp us like hoes; take our dough but they hate us though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck trying to get with these crooked ass hypocrites
They way they see it, we was meant to be kept down
Just can't understand why we gettin respect now
Momma told me they're be days like this
But I'm pissed! Cause it stays like this
And now they tryin to send me off to Kuwait?
Gimme a break! How much shit can a nigga take?
I ain't goin nowhere no how
What you wanna throw down? Better bring your gun pal
Cuz this is the day we make 'em pay
Fuck bailin hay, I bail and spray with an AK
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another nigga bigger from the motherfuckin underground
So step but you better step quick
Cause the clock's goin tick and I'm sick of the bullshit!
You're watchin the makings of a psychopath
The truth didn't last before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the trigger?
Who'd do ya think?! A motherfuckin 90's nigga!
Ready to buck and rip shit up
I had enough! (Yeah) And I don't give a fuck

[Verse Two]
Nigga it ain't just the blacks
It's also a gang of motherfuckers dressed in blue slacks
They say niggaz hang in packs and they attitudes is shitty
So tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggaz in the city?
They say we niggaz like to do niggaz
Throw me in the cuffs with just two niggaz
A street walkin nigga and a beat walkin nigga
with a badge, I had to shoot ya in the past
for the blast take his cash before I smash and bash his head in
Dump him at the dead end and that's just his luck
Cause a nigga like P, don't really give a fuck

[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Walked in the store, what's everybody staring at?
They act like they never seen a motherfucker wearin black
Followin a nigga and shit - ain't this a bitch?
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business else where - but where?
Cause who in the hell cares!
About a black man with a black need
They wanna jack me like some kind of crackfiend
I wonder if he knows that my income
is more than his pension, salary and then some 
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your trife-ass wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mack in fact who's the black jack?
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
While he thinks that he's gettin over
I bust a move as smooth as Casanova
And count another quick mill'
I'm gettin paid for my trade but I'm still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
as strong as a fuckin'nine
Mail stacked up, niggaz wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your backs up
But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot
Used to come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers stay strong keep your heads up
They know we fed up; but they just don't give a fuck

They just don't give a fuck

[Outro: 2Pac]
I gotta give my fuck offs 
Fuck you to the San Francisco Police Department
Fuck you to the Marin County Sheriff's Department
Fuck you to the F.B.I.
Fuck you to the C.I.A.
Fuck you to the B-U-S-H
Fuck you to the AmeriKKKa
Fuck you to all you redneck prejudiced motherfuckers
that wanna fuck with me, fuck y'all!
Punk gay sensitive little dick bastards
+2Paclypse+ motherfuckerin +Now+
Y'all can all kiss MY ass and suck MY dick
And my Uncle Tommy's balls
Fuck y'all
Punks, punks, punks... {*echoes*}</pre>
