Artist: 2Pac f/ Stretch (Live Squad)
Album:  2Pacalypse Now
Song:   Crooked Ass Nigga
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

"Suddenly I see, some niggaz that I don't like" -> Ice Cube
*machine gun fires* "Got him!" -> Dr. Dre

[2Pac]
A smokin ass nigga robbed me blind
I got a tech nine now his smokin ass is mine
I guess I felt sorry for the bastard, he was broke
I didn't know he smoked so I didn't watch him close
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit 
Catch him on the streets, I'ma bring him to his feet, quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him comin now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit ya when we meet
Comin quickly up the streets, is the punk ass police
The first one jumped out and said, "Freeze!"
I popped him in his knees and shot him, punk.. please..
Cause cops should mind they business, when we rush
Now you're pleadin like a bitch, cause you don't know how to.. hush..
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker give me.. body..
One to the chest, another to his fuckin dome
Now the shit can rest, yo tell him to leave me the fuck alone
Two very bloody bodies on the streets
A nosey ass cop and a nigga that robbed from me
Run from your backup punk, how you figure?
My finger's on the trigger for you crooked ass niggaz

[Pac]	Crooked ass niggaz
[Eazy]	Criminal behaviour.. criminal.. criminal behaviour
[Cube]	Suddenly I see..
[Eazy]	Cri-cri-criminal

[Stretch]
Now listen to the mack of the crooked nigga trade
With the fine criminal mind, cold rips like a blade
It's already quick steppin to the niggaz with the props
and any motherfucker with the flim-flam drops to the knot
Ten o'clock, is a motherfuckin gank move
Stretch is Uptown, clockin weight the shit is real smooth
A nigga's tryin to play me like he know me but he don't
Sittin on ten keys, I'ma get him, think I won't?
My nigga 2Pac, got the fuckin Glock cocked, and he's ready
When the kid, didn't even bring the weight bag, instead he
welcomed us, into his apartment
Oh this even better, two to the head, he's dead a clean get-a-WAY!
Niggaz got PAID!
And yet another sleepin ass nigga got slayed, word up
By a crooked motherfucker named Stretch
And the T-U-P-A-C, the police can't catch..

[Pac]	The crooked ass niggaz
[Eazy]	Criminal behaviour..
[Pac]	Yeah.. ya don't stop!
	Crooked ass niggaz
[Eazy]	Criminal.. criminal behaviour
[Cube]	Suddenly I see, some niggaz that I don't like

[2Pac]
Now I could be a crooked nigga too
When I'm rollin with my crew, watch what crooked niggaz, do!
I got a nine millimeter Glock pistol
I'm ready to get witcha at the drop, of a whistle
So make your move, and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots, and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock's like a fuckin mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot, or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke til I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfuckin piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to 'tack me and I'll drop you quick
Long as I got a clip I got some shit to hit em with
The nigga killer I get iller when the shit gets thick
My brain flips, I start thinkin like a lunatic
I rip shit, came equipped with a bigger crew
I thought these niggaz knew, I'm a crooked nigga too

[Eazy]	Criminal behaviour.. criminal.. criminal behaviour
[2Pac]	Crooked

[2Pac]
Crooked ass niggaz come in all shapes and sizes
They wear disguises, backstabbin's what they specialize in
They'll try to getcha, they'll sweatcha to get in the picture
And then they hitcha, son of a bitch!  Now he's richer
Crooked ass nigga..

[Eazy]	Criminal behaviour.. criminal.. criminal behaviour
[Cube]  Suddenly I see, some niggaz that I don't like
[Eazy]	Criminal behaviour
	Criminal, criminal, crim
	Crim-criminal behaviour
	Criminal behaviour, criminal behaviour..
