[Verse One: 2Pac]
Eternally thug nigga
Hilfiger, made by Tommy
So when I speak hope to reach my biunique mammies
Oh come to poppy
I love it when it's wet and sloppy
In and out the mouth piece
Until I cum no one can stop me
My bump and grind'll do ya' every time
Come get a blast of this thug passion
It'll blow ya' mind
Hey
Throw up your legs, rap them shits around my back
It's a Westside thing fucking hoes around the map
Walking down 125 while I'm peeping out hotties
And they
Seduce my Jimmie I'll be screaming give me body
Make 'em all scream my name out
Give me my props and don't you
Love how this thug nigga beat up the cock
I'm at the weekend parade
I'm watching caramel bitches play
Get with real niggas bull shit will never get you paid
This is the dream of a young black teen
I fiend for hoes cross country like a dirty crack fiend
Now come on

[Chorus]
(Hey girl)
I can tell that you want it
By the way your dancing on the floor
(Hey girl)
By the look in your eyes
I can tell you want some more
(Oh girl)
Don't worry bout it just keep doing what you do
(Hey girl)
Girl tonight you can be
International

[Verse Two: Nipsey Hustle]
Ok, look, check it out
Nipsey when I pull up to the club
on them chrome things
I'm crispy
Shining from my wrist to my gold chain
Everywhere I go I keep the hood I never change
If it ain't up on my lap
Got it stashed in the Range
Bang, bang
I'm getting bread on the proper
Private jet anywhere I tell him he go fly to
My respect had these girls saying Daddy I do
Anything you ask get it cracking when I slide through
As God as my witness, right hand on the bible
In Tokyo honey turned it up
hottie got ?? stroked for show
Now up in Atlanta in the strip club
She thick Cuz took me to the stop, where the crib was
Went full throttle got cracking I ain't bashed yet
From the kitchen to the counter top, in the bathroom
Flips mo', trips mo' stamps on my passport
Told her drop me off at Heartsville
I'm international

[Chorus]
(Ohhh)
(Young Dre The Truth, Makaveli
LT Hutton, Nipsey)
(Ohh, International)

[Verse Three: Young Dre]
It's Mr. Hoodnational
Rider with the passport
Just landed from Paris homie pick me up
I'm at the airport
With two bottle's of Moet and a bottle of Port
Can we, get something popping
cause tomorrow got court
So of course I'm ready to get it
Feel it going down right now
Hopped in the whip
popped the bottle in a blood right now
Get it out of it about 50 seconds later
the party right now
We celebrating Makaveli - 2Pacalypse NOW's
Escape through the front though they
?Chewed? up on tippy toes
Cruising up to get the door
If you lose a chick then let her go
She done chose it's over bro
Look around it's Harleyville
Dimes in high heels came from Japan
to New York to Cali to chill
They choosing for real with no grill in my dental
Peep, my swagger tremendous make moves monumental
It was me, three mammies, E-40 and 'Pac
? rounds after party it just don't stop

(Hey girl)
(Ooh, riders)
I can tell that you want it
By the way your dancing on the floor
(Hey girl)
By the look in your eyes
I can tell you want some more
(Oh girl)
Don't worry bout it just keep doing what you do
(Hey girl)
Girl tonight you can be...International
(Ooh, rider's)</pre>
