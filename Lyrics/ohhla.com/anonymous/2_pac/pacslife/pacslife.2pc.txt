Album:  Pac's Life
Song:   Pac's Life
Typed by: damez7@gmail.com

[Intro]
Uh-oh Uh-oh Oohhh!

(Ohh!) They ain't ready for this!

T.I.!

Ashanti!

Let's get it! Ohh!

[Chorus - Ashanti (2Pac)]
Pac's Life! (Everybody needs to cheat!)
Everybody talk about Pac's Life! (2Pac the king!)
What do you know about Pac's Life! (What it is Pac'!)
What do you know about Pac's Life! (Only real niggaz stay on top!)
Everybody talk about Pac's Life! (Outlaws)

[Verse 1 - 2Pac]
Started with five shots, niggaz plottin' to kill em'
Never figured that, that same nigga'd sell five million
Hit the charts like a madman nothin' but hits
Court cases got a nigga facin' multiple digits
Dodgin cop cars look at how we come so far
Picture high school dropout rollin' the double-r
House full of happiness weed and drink
Way out sortin' trouble tryna find me king
Never pictured livin' longer than my twenty-first
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
And though it hurt's to see the change
It comes with the fame
Why we gossip in the silly games
To all the motherfuckers speakin down on me -
This is the night, Why is everybody caught up in Pac's Life
To all ya'll niggaz, conversatin' on my life
Mind your motherfuckin' business!

[Chorus - Ashanti (2Pac)]
Pac's Life! (Everybody needs to cheat!)
Everybody talk about Pac's Life!
What do you know about Pac's Life! (Only real niggaz stay on top!)
What do you know about Pac's Life!
Everybody talk about Pac's Life!

[Verse 2 - T.I. (2Pac)]
I remember that!
(Outlaws!)

Ey, what's happenin Pac' yeah I know we never got to meet
But we know all the same people so we got the speed
You taught me first -- fate nigga can't stop a G
And all that shit you went through meant alot to me
Watchin you lockin up with him, was a shame to see
You know crack in the business did the same thing to me
I get along with real niggaz, it's a lane to be
Talkin' loud outta pocket tryna bang wit' me
Well so I'm pullin' out my pocket, let it rain ya' see
Now they all in the court room, blamin' me
See we lived the same life and represent the same struggle
Power to the real nigga and death to the sucker
Money over bitches get to know em' before you love em'
Death before dishonor never talk to army trouble
Live by the same rules, so my wrist's tattooed
With the same sorta' dude, with the same short fuse

[Chorus - Ashanti (2Pac)]
Pac's Life! (Everybody needs to cheat!)
Everybody talk about Pac's Life!
What do you know about Pac's Life! (Only real niggaz stay on top!)
What do you know about Pac's Life!
Everybody talk about Pac's Life!

[Verse 3 - 2Pac]
I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Movin' my tapes in major ways, cause every dollar counts
Bustas is jealous and half these niggaz is punks
They runnin' off at the mouth 'til I fill it up with my pump
They jump my automatic keep 'em weary while you fronting like you Billy bad ass
Nigga you scary I been knowing you for years we was high school peers
In Junior High I was itchin' to kill and you was ready to die
While you bullshitting niggaz was dying and catching cases
Busting my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leaving no trace they see my face and then they buried
Them bitches die in a hurry still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd and muthafuckas die
It's not the way I wanna live my nigga
It's how it is, Only real niggaz stay on top!

Word Up!

[Chorus - Ashanti (2Pac)]
Pac's Life! (Everybody needs to cheat!)
Everybody talk about Pac's Life!
What do you know about Pac's Life! (Why ya'll niggaz all up in my shit?)
What do you know about Pac's Life! (Tell em' motherfuckers)
Everybody talk about Pac's Life! (Outlaws!)

[Outro]
Fuck all Ya'll!!</pre>
