Outlawz, in this
No doubt
Death Row, Makaveli
You can call me daddy, uh
I'll be ya daddy, that's right, uh
Just like daddy
Fo' the ladies

Hahaha

[Chorus]
Come with me every time we ro'
Dedicate slow jams on the radio.. oh why
Know ya happy, I can feel ya passion
Lookin out fo ya just like daddy.. come on
Sunshine turns to rain,
Baby I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me, close ya eyes feel the magic
neva leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy

[Khadafi]
I mer her when she was younger, her daddy died when she was younger
Her moms let her do what she please, an' seen no one loved her
Her eyes shined of love, a diamond in the rough
The kind that you could love; not yet touch, but so much, potential
Youngster let me guide ya mental
and to a place, with a sourness of pain you'll never taste
By God's grace, you was born with that face
Nothin but pure beauty; so for an eternity, I feel it's my duty
to be a souljah (souljah) yeah, baby got plans to mold ya
In the coldest nights is when I hold ya
Like I'm supposed to, as we roll closer
I'll take yo' hand gladly, anything you need, ask me
Supportin' my baby girl just like daddy

[Makaveli]
To aliviate the stress, spendin time wit you, I feel blessed
When you gone, feel ths pain so strong deep in my chest
When I got arrested, came so close to goin' to jail
throwin blows at the po-pos breakin' ya nails
Screamin loud goin' all out, damn I did
You stayed locked down at moms house, watchin the kids
Through the whole bid in the V-I, I see ya daily
While my fake homies try to fuck you, you run and tell me
That's why I stay committed, I thank God everytime I hit it
hopin you'll forgive me for all the times I bullshitted
Me and you against the world, we untouchable
Screamin like you dyin everytime I'm fuckin you
Ya never had a father or a family, but I'll be there
No need to fear so much insanity, and through the years
I know ya gave me your heart, plus
when I'm dirt broke and fucked up, ya still love me

[Chorus]

[Khadafi]
Boo, would ya die for me?
Down holdin' my pistol, gettin high
with mean sounds tougher than bristles
but when you cry I'll be ya tissue
Back in the county written letters, how I miss you
Givin' you credit, apoligetic how I diss you
Kiss you for thinkin' like a mona and on a level
And sometime daddy ready to wine ya and dialation
For a total twine ya, we right behind ya true
Life just me and you, no tellin what we could do
Gettin high between the sheets, make the shit right here discrete
puttin Nike's on ya belly while we fuckin on the beach
I love it when ya nut up and grab me
I feel for ya badly, baby girl just like daddy

[Young Noble]
Shorty I lend my hand out ta help ya, lost soul lookin' for shelter
On late night accept it, treat ya good, wont disrespect ya
My age is young; out of place bitch days is done
From a trixy to a missy, you know I raised ya hun
Placed her under my wing, showed her how we swing
Now she rolling blunts for her king
One day labelled thug misses, the essence of my ghetto sisters
Hugs and kisses, that's just for me to be a father figure

(Chorus repeat to fade)
[2Pac over chorus]
C'mon

Throw ya hands up
Put ya hands up
Throw ya hands up
Put ya hands up
Throw ya hands up
Put ya hands up
Put ya hands up
Throw ya hands up

Where my sistas?
Where my sistas at?
Where my sistas?
Where my sistas at?
Where my sistas?
Where my sistas at?
Throw ya hands in the air, uh
