Artist: Makaveli (2Pac)
Album:  The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory
Song:   White Man'z World
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

"You go bustin your fist against a stone wall, 
 you're not usin your brain. That's what the white man wants you to do.
 Look at you! What makes you ashamed of bein black?"

(Nuttin but love for you my sister)
Might even know how hard it is (no doubt)
Bein a woman, a black woman at that? (no doubt)
Shit - in this white man's world
Sometimes we overlook the fact that we be ridin hard on our sisters
we don't be knowin the pain we be causin (in this white man's world)
In this white man's world.. I ain't sayin I'm innocent in all this
I'm just sayin (in this white man's world)
This song is for y'all
For all those times that I messed up or we messed up

[2Pac]
Dear sister, got me twisted up in prison I miss ya
Cryin lookin at my niece's and my newphew's picture
They say don't let this cruel world get ya, kinda suspicious
Swearin one day you might leave me, for somebody that's richer
Twist the cap off the bottle, I take a sip and see tomorrow
Gotta make if I have to beg or borrow
Readin love letters; late night, locked down and quiet
If brothers don't recieve they mail best believe we riot
Eatin Jack-Mack, starin at walls of silence
inside this cage where they captured all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons, never fall for riches
Aplogizies to my TRUE sisters; far from bitches
Help me raise my black nation reperations are due, it's true
Caught up in this world I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them, precious boys and girls
Born black in this white man's world - and all I heard was

[Chorus - sung]
Who, knows what tomorrow brings
In this world, where everyone's blind
And where to go, no matter how far I'll find
To let you know, that you're not alone

[2Pac over Chorus]
Only thing they ever did wrong (YES, YES)
was bein born black, in this white man's world (NO DOUBT)
  (All my ghetto motherfuckers be proud to be black and be PROUD)
All my little black seeds, born black in this white man's world
  (to have this shit like this, cause ain't NOBODY got it like this)
  (All these motherfuckers wanna be like us, they all wanna be like us)
  (To be the have-nots, all hail)
  (God bless the child that can hold his own, no motherfuckin doubt)

[2Pac]
Bein born with less I must confess only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homie's head, dyed in his vest
Shot him to death and left him bleedin for his family to see
I pass his casket gently askin, is there heaven for G's?
My homeboy's doin life, his baby momma be stressin
Sheddin tears when her son, finally ask that questions
Where my daddy at? Mama why we live so poor?
Why you cryin? Heard you late night through my bedroom door
Now do you love me mama? Whitey keep on callin me nigga?
Get my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm bigger
And still thuggin in this jail cell, missin my block
Hearin brothers screamin all night, wishin they'd stop
Proud to be black but why we act like we don't love ourselves
Don't look around busta (you sucka) check yourselves
Know what it MEANS to be black, whether a man or girl
We still strugglin, in this white man's world

[Chorus]

[*megaphone* over Chorus]
We must fight, for brother Mumia
We must fight, for brother Mutulu
And we must fight, for brother (?)
We must fight, for brother Geronimo Pratt
We must fight.. for (?), Zulu, (?)
We must fight, for the government's political prisoners
They are locked up falsely by this white man

[2Pac]
So tell me why you - 
changed to choose a new direction, in the blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die?
Not gon' cry, why should I care
Like we holdin on to lost love that's no longer there
Can you please help me, God bless me please keep my seeds healthy
Makin all my enemies bleed while my G's wealthy
Hopin they bury me with ammunitions, weed, and shells
Just in case they trip in heaven - ain't no G's hell
Sister sorry for the pain that I caused your heart
I know I'll change if you help me, but don't fall apart
Rest in peace to Latasha, Lil' Yummy, and Kato
Too much for this cold world to take - ended up bein fatal
Every women in America, especially black
Bear with me, can't you see, that we under attack
I never meant to cause drama, to my sister and mama
Hope we make it, to better times, in this white man's world

[Chorus] - 3X

[Dialogue over Chorus]
"You're out of touch with reality!
 There are a few of you in a few smoke filled rooms (?) that
 the mainstream wound up masses of the people
 White and black, red yellow, and, and brown
 Poor and vulnerable are suffering, in this nation."

[2Pac over Chorus]
Remember that, in this white man's world, they can't stop us
We've been here all this time they ain't took us out
They can never take us out
No matter what they say, about us bein extinct
about us being endangered species, we ain't NEVER gon' leave this
We ain't NEVER gon' walk off this planet, unless Y'ALL choose to
Use your brain, use your brain
It ain't THEM that's killin us it's US that's killin us
It ain't THEM that's knockin us off, it's US that's knockin us off
I'm tellin you better watch it, or be a victim
Be a victim, in this white man's world..
.. born black, in this white man's world, no doubt
And it's dedicated to my motherfuckin teachers
Mutulu Shakur, Geronimo Pratt, Mumia Abu Jamal
Sekou Odinga, all the real O.G.'s, we out

[Minister Farrakhan - Oct. 17, 1995]
The seal, and the constitution, reflect the thinking
of the founding fathers, that this was, to be a nation
by white people, and for white people.  Native americans, 
blacks, and all other non-white people, were to be the 
burden bearers, for the real citizens of this nation.</pre>
