Artist: Tupac Shakur ~ Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
Album:  The Rose Vol. 2 *
Song:   Power of a Smile
Typed by: rishi_brar@hotmail.com

* Poems written by Shakur as ~ interpreted by other artists

[Layzie Bone - reciting 'Power of a Smile' poem]
The power of a gun can kill, and the power of fire can burn
The power of wind can chill, and the power of mind can learn
The power of anger, can raise inside until it tears you apart
But the power of a smile, especially yours, can heal a frozen heart

[Krayzie Bone over poem]
And tomorrow, we'll wake up with the promise of a smile, smile
Yes, maybe tomorrow, we'll wake up with the promise, of a smile

[Wish Bone]
Rest in peace..
Tupac, Bone Thugs
In His Own Words
Let's go

[Wish Bone]
And tomorrow, morrow, morrow, and tomorrow, morrow
And tomorrow, morrow, and tomorrow we

[Hook - Krayzie Bone (Wish Bone)]
I see the light... (and tomorrow, morrow, morrow)
I can see the light... (and tomorrow, tomorrow)
I see the light... (and tomorrow we)
See the light that shines... (and tomorrow we)

[Krayzie Bone]
Well, we still looking for better days
Hoping tomorrow can bring us some bigger and better things
So we can escape this maze, and they give us our change in every way
And maybe tomorrow, can bring us the truth
and there'll be no more use, for the pain and sorrow
Let's put it to use and then maybe the youth, can come and follow
And we can leave all our problems in the bottle, tomorrow
Maybe god'll wipe our eyes and we'll never have to cry no more
Or even better, have to die no more
Politicians can't tell us lies no more, he decides no more
Maybe tomorrow, it can be our daylight
Just might be our sunshine, sunshine..
Yesterday is filled with so much misery and drama
And today it don't seem like I'm getting any further
Praying tomorrow we can somehow come out of the struggle
And need no more hustle, no stumblin cause we all one muscle..
Still looking for a better day, day, and a better way, way, way..
So let's hope tomorrow... can lead us to the place we tryin to be..
In heavenly harmony, in heavenly harmony!

[Hook - 2X]

[Wish Bone]
Where there's a will there's a way, don't let it stand in your way
Look 'em straight in they face, let 'em know you ain't playing no games
We searching for better days, wanna live them better ways
What I promise, heart is all you need to rock
Be honest, succeed, just look at me!
If I can do it, you can do it, we can do it, just believe, believe, believe!
When I lay down, I think about some of the wrong things I done
So I pray now, for God to erase some of that wrong
Wipe my soul clean, to be wanted, when he calls me, when he calls me!
So I can't sleep, cause I'm worried, I done did things, lord forgive me!
It's a damn shame, the things we do to get it our way!
Snitch on thugs, just to get it, your pay!
Nowadays I act right, in the past we used to fight
Where the loyalty at? Where them real street thugs? Where the thug life?
Where there's a will there's a way!

[Hook - 2X]

[Layzie Bone]
So as the hours pass by, in the event of my demise
Tell my momma not to cry, these are the words of the wise
Look at liberty needing glasses now that the promise been broken
For the better, keep on hopin, powerful words that's spoken
What I'm quotin is a G, acquired his knowledge from the streets
Makaveli, Tupac Shakur, was the rose that grew from concrete
America's most complete artist, regardless, one of the hardest
On a mission to make it better, with the soul of Malcom and Martin
Mixed with a little Garvin, today he got us callin
Our brighter star is fallen, but now before he was ballin
Out of control, quick to let a nigga know what he stood for, be a friend or foe
And I bring the truth in the booth cause ain't nobody gon help me
This is life, it's a gamble, and I'ma scramble till my pockets wealthy
Fuck what they tell me, I'm all about my biz
Bitch, street biz or showbiz, I'ma make y'all know this
And I'ma say this to every man, woman and child
Don't you ever be afraid to smile, smile for me now
And I'ma say this to every man, woman and child
Don't you ever be afraid to smile... the power of a smile!
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone! Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone!
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone! Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone!

[Layzie Bone over hook - 2X]
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone, Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone
