[Tupac]
Cause I hate to spend
My life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin one-time! (Lost Soul)
How it start, how it start

Started off with, runnin from copses duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire, who can stop us
Livin the life of trife juveniles, hopin for righteous
Gettin twenty-five to life, if the judge don't like us
In my clearest pictures, I see authorities itchin to get us
ATF state feds scandalous bitches
I wasn't promised to it, wasn't bitter or sweet
See if a, nigga don't hustle then the nigga don't eat
Only streets livin do or die circle complete
Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for cheese
Please understand my history a man of many acts
Livin Thug Life, comin equipped, with many gats
Maybe I was just a Lost Soul, trapped in time
Livin in between life, and the cracks were blind
Even though we had hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain

Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin one-time!  Stranded in the County in the worst way
Hell of a way to spend my twenty-first birthday
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost Souls...

Lost Souls nigga, for my homeboys that passed on
Words from the mind of a Lost Soul

Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin one-time!

[Young Noble]
My brother Sean, first on my list, he stuck with
a three-five when he get out would I be dead or alive
He taught me the rules so much, but still In Thugs I Trust
When in danger never hesitate to keep my fuckin trap shut
My Mom Dukes got a little bit of Thug in her
The Devil loves sinners crackheads and drug dealer
Sometimes I feel like the streets are takin over
Never stayin sober, the brain over and over backtrack
My stack's fat, I used to take new
One love to my crew aiyyo this one's for you

[Tupac]
R.I.P., rest in peace to Moo Brown
Know what we gotta do baby, one-time

Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin one-time!
(repeat 2X)

One-time!  One-time!  One-time!

[Idi Amin]
I was born twenty-two years ago, yesterday
But see I saw no reason for me to celebrate, let me demonstrate
Entered the world from out a poisonous womb
Heroin bein consumed already predicitin my doom, soon
to be one of the many misguided
Always the first one on the block to be done tried it and liked it
Lost before I had a chance to find my way
Now I travel through life, not knowin the time of day
Crime for pay, I'm on my way, but don't know, where I'ma end up
I swear to God, it's just a setup
And these are the words from the mind of a Lost Soul (I'ma Lost Soul)

[Tupac]
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin one-time!
(repeat 8X)

All of y'all, keepin y'all in health

To all of y'all, keepin y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
(repeat 2X)

For all my Doggz, keepin y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
(repeat 3X)

Throw your hands up (4X to fade)</pre>
