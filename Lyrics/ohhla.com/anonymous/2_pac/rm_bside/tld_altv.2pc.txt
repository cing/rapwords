Artist: 2Pac (Makaveli) f/ Val Young
Album:  The Ultimate Death Row Collection
Song:   To Live & Die In L.A. (Alternative Version)
Typed by: westbingmanson@gmail.com

[Intro: 2Pac]
I luv L.A...
No doubt... to live and die in L.A.
California -- what you say about Los Angeles
Still the only place for me that never rains in the sun
and everybody got love

[Verse One: 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A., where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggaz hustle for the cash so it's hard to knok it
Everybody got they own thang, currency chasin
Worldwide through the hard times, warrior faces
Shed tears as we bury niggaz close to heart
What was a friend now a ghost in the dark, cold hearted bout it
Nigga got smoked by a fiend, tryin to floss on him
Blind to a broken man's dream, a hard lesson
Court cases keep me guessin, plea bargain
ain't an option now, so I'm stressin, cost me more
to be free than a life in the pen
Makin money off of cuss words, writin again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down Sunset likin the scene
What's the worst they could do to a nigga got me lost in hell
To live and die in L.A. on bail, my angel sing

[Chorus: Val Young] + (2Pac over chorus)
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
(Let my angel sing)
You've got to be there to know it, what everybody wanna see
(To live and die in L.A.)
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
(Let my angel sing)
You've got to be there to know it, what everybody wanna see
(Love, hehe)

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
It's the, City of Angels and constant danger
South Central L.A., can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera, on the curb
Watchin the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggaz gettin three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear the pen the right across from hell, I can't cry
Cause it's on now, I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin life Thug style, so I can't smile
Writin to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin Cali just fun and bitches, hahaha
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggaz copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love woman
Cause every nigga in L.A. got a little bit of Thug in him
We might fight amongst each other, but I promise you this
We'll burn this bitch down, get us pissed
To live and die in L.A.

[Chorus: Val Young] + (2Pac over chorus)
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
(Let my angel sing)
You've got to be there to know it, what everybody wanna see
(Let my angel sing)
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
(To live and die in L.A.)
You've got to be there to know it, what everybody wanna see
(Let my angel sing)

[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Cause would it be L.A. without Mexicans?
Black love brown pride and the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin to see us all broke, I'm on some bullshit
Out for everything they owe, remember K-DAY
Weekends, Crenshaw -- MLK
Automatics rang free, niggaz lost they way
Gang signs being showed, nigga love your hood
But reconize and it's all good, where the weed at?
Niggaz gettin shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this muhfucka perved out, M.O.B.
Big Suge in the Low-Low, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex, wit a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggaz with me, OFTB
They got some hash took the stash left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tre, Herron, Big Buntry too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin it pay
Gettin high watchin time fly, to live and die in L.A.

[Chorus: Val Young] + (2Pac over chorus)

To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
(Let my angel sing)
You've got to be there to know it, what everybody wanna see
(Let my angel sing)
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
(To live and die in L.A.)
You've got to be there to know it, what everybody wanna see
(Let my angel sing)

[Outro: 2Pac]
This go out for 92.3, and 106
All the radio stations that be bumpin my shit
Makin my shit sells katruple quitraple platinum, hehe
This go out to all the magazines that supported me
All the real motherfuckers
All the stores, the mom and pop spots
A&R people, all y'all motherfuckers
L.A., California Love part motherfuckin Two
Without gay ass Dre</pre>
