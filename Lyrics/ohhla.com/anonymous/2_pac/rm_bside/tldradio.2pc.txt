Artist: 2Pac (Makaveli) f/ Val Young
Album:  To Live & Die In L.A. 12"
Song:   To Live & Die In L.A. (Radio Version)
Typed by: chaloveli@gmail.com

(Intro: Tupac)

Somebody need to do a song for L.A.
Straight up this go out to California
This go out to L.A.
The new anthem
California love part two
One time
To live and die in L.A.
Westside
Westside
Westside

Verse One:

To live and die in L.A.
Where everybody tryna to fatten they pockets
So many hustle for the cash so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thang
Currency chasin'
Worldwide through the hard times
Worryin' faces
Shed tears as we bury brothers close to heart
What was a friend now a ghost in the dark
Hard part bout it
Brother got smoked by a fiend
Tryin' to floss on him
Blind to a broken man's dream
A hard lesson
Court cases keep em' guessin'
Plea bargin' ain't an option now
So I'm stressin,
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen
Makin' money off of cuss words
Writin' again
Learn how to think ahead
So I fight with my pen
Late night down Sunset
Likin' the scene
What's the worst they could do to a player
Got me lost in hell
To live and die in L.A. on bail
My people say

(Chorus x2 : Val Young)

To live and die in L.A.
It's the place to be (To live and die in L.A.)
You've got to be there to know it
What everybody wanna see (To live and die in L.A.)

Verse Two:

It's the
City of Angels and constant danger
South Central L.A.
Can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera
On the curb
Watchin' the ghetto bird helicopters
Observe
So many homies gettin' three strikes
Tossed in jail
I swear the pen the right across from hell
I can't cry
Cause It's home now
I'm just a player on his own now
Livin' life Thug style
So I can't smile
Writin' to my love ones sendin' em' pictures
Thinkin' Cali just sun and switches
Hahaha
Better learn about the dress code
B's and C's
All them other suckers copycats
These is G's
I love Cali like I love woman
Cause every brother in L.A got a little bit of thug in him
We might fight with each other
But I promise you this
We'll tear the roof off get us blitzed
To live and die in L.A.

Chorus x2

Verse Three:

It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans
Black love brown pride and the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin' to see us all broke
I'm on some madness
Out for everything they owe
Remember K-DAY
Weekends, Crenshaw MLK
Automatics rang free
Guess we lost they way
Gang signs being shown
Brother love your hood
But reconize and it's all good
Where my G's at
Brothers gettin shermed out
Snoop Dogg in the Double R permed out
M.O.B
Big Suge got the Low-Low bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex
Mo' amounts to earn
I got some Watts players with me O.F.T.B
They brought some food but i'm cool left the rest for me
I got Neckbone, Head Ron, Punchy too
Big Rock plus Trey
But this one's for you
I hit the studio, drop a jewel
Hopin' it pay
Live my life watchin' time fly
To live and die in L.A.

(Chorus repeated till the end)

(Tupac talking)

I send this one out for 92.3, and 106
All the radio stations across the country that be bumpin'
So we go katruple quitraple and 5 times platinum
All the fans that bought my album
All the true ones
The East Coast, The West
The North and South
One love
California Love part Two
Without gay Dre
Hahaha
What side
West side
Makaveli the don
Death Row's finest</pre>
