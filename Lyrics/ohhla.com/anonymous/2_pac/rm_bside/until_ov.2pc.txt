Artist: 2Pac f/ 6.9.
Album:  Until the End of Time CD Maxi Single
Song:   Until the End of Time (Original Version)
Typed by: westbingmanson@gmail.com

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was addicted to tha dark side
Some where inside my childhood I missed my heart die
And even though we both came from tha same places
Tha money and tha fame made us all change places
Could it be through tha misery
That can't get past the hard times
Made a true friend afraid to ask my currency
But you could run to me when you need it
I'll never leave honestly someone to believe in
As you can see this is our thang through and true
What can I do real homies help you get through
And comin' new he'd do tha same thang if he could
Cuz in tha hood true homies make you feel good
And happy times we be actin' up call tha cops
Bringin' tha cease to tha peace that was on my block
It never stop, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah but it's clear I'll always be tha same
Until tha end of time

[Chorus: 6.9.]
What's in me, that's got me actin' so crazy?
Don't be afraid, keep hopin' for a better day

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know I don't hang around tha house much
Diss all night money makin' got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of tha ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my low-low
Watchin' tha whole world move in slow mo
For quite times and steer fearless to tha ocean
Smokin' ports think my thoughts
Then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world
My phony homie had a baby by my own girl
But I ain't trippin' I'm a playa
I ain't sweatin' him
I sex his sister had her mo' good like a Mexican
His next of kin
No immores it was meant to happen
Besides rappin' tha only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until tha end of time

[Chorus: 6.9.]
What's in me, that's got me actin' so crazy?
Don't be afraid, keep hopin' for a better day

[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?
Till in my life,
As an Outlaw all alone
Remain strong in this planet full of playa hataz
They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in tha end drinkin' henassy made all my enemies envy me
So go when I flow illuminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breath
While beggin' me to keep tha peace haha
Well I can see close into achieve
In times of danger don't freeze time to be a chief
Follow my lead I supply everything you need
An ounce of game and tha trainin' to make a G'
Remember me?
As an Outcast Outlaw
Another album out that's what I'm about
More, gettin' raw 'till tha day I see my casket
Buried as a G' while tha whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

[Chorus: 6.9.]
What's in me, that's got me actin' so crazy?
Don't be afraid, keep hopin' for a better day</pre>
