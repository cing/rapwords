Song:   Throw Your Hands Up
Typed by: Josh, chaloveli@gmail.com

2Pac (talking)

hehehe (we can throw it off nigga)
2 niggas about to have a fight, look, look (we can throw it off nigga)

(What's up nigga? What's up?)

Throw yo mothafuckin hands up nigga
That's right, we gone take it back
These mothafuckas goin to start catching lefts and rights and uppercuts
I don't give a fuck
throw your guns down, lets have fun now

Throw Your Hands Up, that's right nigga
we goin ol' school on these suckas

[Verse 1]

How many suckas wanna see me,
jealous, cause they peepin me on tv
mad, cause they bitches wanna G me
now take it easy, it ain't my fault
to see a hooka, you shoulda shooka
don't playa hate me when I tooka
life of a crook
look at them thug niggas ballin y'all,
I gotcha hoochies full of liquor fucking all a y'all
and my, name
will be synonymous with spittin game
slangin' 'caine, it ain't the same
niggas betta change
them 3 strikes will have ya stretched fo life
get arrested twice
the third time fo life, and I
don't think you understand me G
that penitentiary time just ain't the plan fo me
I got a, new thang, get cha paperz and do thang
niggas ain't following ya true game, cause if they was
they wouldn't be runnin' for they trunk
every time that its time for funk
mothafucka Throw Yo Hands Up

[Chorus:Killa, Moe ZMD & Ronnie Love]

Leave the guns and the knives at home
don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on
throw ya hands (throw ya hands up)
throw ya hands up in the air (get em up)
come on
throw ya hands up
leave the guns and the knives at home
don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on
(we don't punk ya trick ass nigga)
come on
throw ya hands up (throw ya hands up)
throw ya hands up (get em up)

[Verse 2]

Could it be, that controversy was my destiny
I let my anger get the best of me
everywhere we hang its the same thang
in '95 you can die if ya gang bang
you could survive, gettin' high like a true G
can't close my eyes cause these cowards wanna do me
and sue me
I've been hustlin' since day one
out on the block and neva stop until my pay come
but now a days
its like bang, bang, duck quick
I guess you rookies tough shit, cause you bust clips
but suck dick
cause a kid got his cap pealed
the rap deal, from the phonies who pack steel
and act ill
everybody wanna act hard
I swear to god
it's the season to pull a niggas card
you fuckin fraud
can't handle business like a souljah
I bet you too petrified to throw it from the shoulda
nigga, now Throw Your Hands Up

[Chorus:Killa, Moe ZMD & Ronnie Love]

Leave the gunz and the knives at home
don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on
throw ya hands up (throw ya hands up)
throw ya hands up (what you scared of nigga, what you goin for the trunk
for)
get em up, come on
throw ya hands up
leave the gunz and the knives at home
don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on (i knew you was a punk)
throw ya hands up (throw ya hands up)
(that nigga don't wanna fight) get em up
(tell that lil trick to shut up)

[Verse 3]

Last year mothafuckas tryda bury me deep
I had beef in every city
screamin fuck the police
couldn't sleep
I'm havin thoughts about the baddest bitches
picture me mobbin in a rag wit switches
punk snitch
I let a trick be a trick
when he slippin, leave em slippin
in the middle of the streets while I'm pimpin
you can throw a sign
but I'm blind to that punk shit
runnin with some real mothafuckas and we run shit
fuck the dumb shit
I ain't stoppin its a high speed
rollin on tha 405 puffin thai weed
I'm shiftin gears
then I disappear
listen here
if they take me alive I'm doin' years
but still no fear
cause I don't think they can catch me
this 350
will put the bitches right in back of me
they wont jack me
and just when I thought I passed
I fucked around and went low on gas
all I heard was Throw Yo Hands Up

[Chorus:Killa, Moe ZMD & Ronnie Love]


Leave ya guns and ya knives at home (damn)
don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on (shit, throw ya hands up)
throw ya hands up (throw ya hands up)
get em up (shit)
come on
Leave ya guns and ya knives at home (hey don't shoot nigga, I got my hands
up don't shoot)
don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on
throw ya hands up (throw ya hands up)
(don't shoot, my hands up, I'm comin out the car now)
get em up
throw ya hands up

(talking)

All y'all niggas out there thinkin y'all really like you know
tearin' shit up
but ya really ain't bro
you only tearin' the police to the blocks
face it
soon them niggas gone be comin' wit army tanks and shit
just mowin niggas down
plus have you mothafuckas cant shoot no one
put the mothafucking guns down
nigga lets take it from the shouldas
if you a real mothafuckin souljah

[Chorus:Killa , Moe ZMD & Ronnie Love]x4

Leave the guns and the knives at home
don't be a punk ass nigga when the time is on
throw ya hands (throw ya hands up)
get em up
come on

We don't need no gat
we don't have to go out like that
just throw ya mothafuckin hands in the air (x2)
come on
throw ya hands in the air
wave em like you just don't care
oooooh yea......

We out this bitch, Mosley ...</pre>
