Artist: 2Pac f/ Dwele
Album:  Nu Mixx Klazzics Vol.2 - Evolution: Duets And Remixes
Song:   Starin' Through My Rearview (Remix)
Typed by: westbingmanson@gmail.com

[2Pac talking]
Staring at the world through my rearview
Just looking back at the world, from another level yaknowhatImean? (ha ha)
Starin...

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
Niggaz is callin cops, people shot, nobody stop
I wonder when the world stopped caring last night
Two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society, first they try
to murder me, then they lie to me, product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed, now the little baby's
crazed raised off Hennesey, tell me will my enemies
flee when they see me, believe me
Even Thugs gotta learn to take it easy, listen
Through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
and we turnin Bad Boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggaz in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga rollin with a posse
full of paranoid drug dealers, to the end my friend

I'm seein nuttin but my dreams comin true
While I'm starin at the world through my rearview (see)
[repeat 2X]

[Chorus]
As life grows bigger, thangs is looking smaller through my
rear view mirror, my days is growing shorter
As my time goes nearer, but I can't be mad cause I've seen my dreams
Fly higher than I've ever seen

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, countin days in this livin black Hell, do you feel me?
Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
Niggaz hate me in the section from years of chin checkin
Turn to Smith and Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father I'm a soldier, I'm gettin hotter
cause the world's gettin colder, baby let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run look at my bitches

Now I know the answers to the question, do dreams come true
Still starin at the world through my rearview (I say)
[repeat 2X]

(They got me) starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly -
and all my motherfuckers
[repeat 2X]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Dwele]
Funny how thangs is looking smaller through my, rear view mirror
I'mma to talk to God I made it, he can hear me now that I'm closer
I dun lived my dreams in reality over and over
Seems just yesterday things was bigger, but I'm for (the now?)

[Chorus]

[2Pac (Pac's hook repeated in the background layer)]
You ain't knowin what we mean by starin through the rearview
So since you ain't knowin what we mean let me break down understandin
The world, the world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
and what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more
The world is a game to be played
So now we lookin at the world, from like, behind us
Niggaz know what we gotta do, just gotta put our mind to it and do it
It's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggaz do they wanna do, bitch niggaz do what they can't

Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly, ya know/and we'll be

[repeat 3X with vocal fade]</pre>
