[EDI]             Come on
[2Pac]           Yeahh!
[2Pac & EDI] It's all about you
[EDI]             One time!
[2Pac]           One my lady, one my lady
                     It's all about you
[Yaki Kadafi]  It's all about you...
[EDI]             Turn it up, Turn it up, Turn it up
[2Pac]           It's all about you
                    Turn it shit baby...
[EDI]            Ohh my shit
[2Pac]          Oh my...


[2Pac]
You probably crooked as the last trick (Trick!), want it light
but how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch (Bitch!)
Thinkin I had her but she had me in the long run (Long run!)
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin with the wrong one, uh! (Wrong one, uh!)
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin with a thug (Thuuug!)
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin for some love
In every club (Every club!), I see you starin like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night (Last night!)
Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life (Fast life!)
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin
Guess it's true what they tellin me
Fresh out of jail, life's Hell for a black, celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you widdit
Fantansies of us sweatin, can I hit it?  (Hahaha)
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin Boo, is this is all about you

[Chorus: 2Pac & Outlawz]
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-oooo
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoeee
(It's all about you)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-oooo
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoeee

[2Pac]
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga; I only hung out
with the criminals and the drug dealers, I love niggaz
cause we comin from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick, the game takes (the game takes!)
How can I tell her I'm a playa, and I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes (Hoeee!)
waitin for niggaz at the end, of every show
I just seen you in my friend's, video (Videooo!)
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go (Gooo!)
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin through..
It's all about you.. hahaha, yeah nigga!
It's all about you!

[Yaki Kadafi]
You, you, you, and you, and you

[2Pac]
It's all about you!

[Chorus: 2Pac & Outlawz]
Every other city we goooo, every other vi-de-ooooo
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoeee
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-oooo
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoeeeee

[Yaki Kadafi]
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Golddiggin, cold diggin a gold Rolex

[Young Noble]
I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin me
Runnin up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia

[EDI]
It's all about you!</pre>
