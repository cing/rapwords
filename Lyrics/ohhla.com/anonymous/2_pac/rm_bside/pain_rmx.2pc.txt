[Tupac]
They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin' high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school kickin' up dust
But now I'm labelled as a trouble maker who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless rollin' down the freeway swervin, don't worry
I'm about to crash up on the curb cause my visions blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me, what should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family, what else could I do
But be a thug
Out slangin' with the homies
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the club
Got my mind on danger
Never been a stranger to homicide
My cities full of gang bangers and drive bys
Why do we die at an early age
He was so young
But still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse
Mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin back to court
So fuck what you thought I'm drinkin' hennessey
Runnin from my enemies will I live to be 23
There's So Much Pain

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy {Styles P.}]
I'ma solider 'till I die
{I'ma die a thug}
Keep standin' by my side
I'll admit i'm gettin' high
Lifes so full of pain, have you ever seen a thug cry?

Momma's standin on the streets
Gotta get back on my feet
Stressed so much can't sleep
{So Much Pain, So Much Pain}
Lifes so full of pain, have you ever seen a thug cry?

[Styles P]
I've seen a couple niggas shot in the brain
Seen a couple niggas shot in the frame
And i'm tryin to maintain, tell the truth though
The shit ain't the same, i'ma die a thug
And fuck it it's the blood in my veins
Why complain 'cause we all gon' die, but I can wait
I'm the letter after F and right before H
I'ma G, nigga see nigga the pain in my eyes
Playa playa play the game ya die
I do a buck eighty five in the rain in the ride
Eatin hot from the flame of the nine
No stranger to danger am I
Matter of fact i'll be bangin for mine
Got a closet full of guns and i'm hangin wit' mine
+So Much Pain+
Yeah I spend years doin' sicker shit
If I cried the tears would prolly be blood and liquor mixed
And you ain't seen no nigga on no thicker shit
Lifes a bitch betcha that
All my niggas that twisted it

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy {Styles P.}]
I'ma solider 'till I die
{I'ma die a thug}
Keep standin' by my side
I'll admit i'm gettin' high
Lifes so full of pain, have you ever seen a thug cry?

Momma's standin on the streets
Gotta get back on my feet
Stressed so much I can't sleep
{So Much Pain, So Much Pain}
Lifes so full of pain, have you ever seen a thug cry?

[Tupac]
They got me mobbin like I'm
Loc'ed and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust, I got my glock cocked playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a - paaassion
Better duck cause I ain't lookin when I'm - blaaastin
I'm a nuttin drinkin Hennessey and gettin' high
On the lookout for my enemies, don't wanna die
Tell me why cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck-fifty across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
Keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
These sorry bastards
Want to kill me in my sleep but will they can I see
And everyday it just a struggle
Steady thuggin' in the streets
And i'll be ballin' loc
Don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckas till you buried
I was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta,
With a mother on drugs
I'm kickin dust up
Ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin' mean
Until they kill me
I'll be livin this life
I know you feel me
There's So Much Pain

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy {Styles P.}]
I'ma solider 'till I die
{I'ma die a thug}
Keep standin' by my side
I'll admit i'm gettin' high
Lifes so full of pain, have you ever seen a thug cry?

Momma's standin on the streets
Gotta get back on my feet
Stressed so much I can't sleep
{So Much Pain, So Much Pain}
Lifes so full of pain, have you ever seen a thug cry?
