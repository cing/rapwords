Artist: 2Pac
Album:  Pour Out a Little Liquor 12"
Song:   Pour Out a Little Liquor (Radio Version)
Typed by: westbingmanson@gmail.com

[Intro]
Yeah
Pour out a little liquor, that radio version
You know

[Verse 1]
I started young kickin' dust and
Livin' rough
You watch you mouth around my mama you couldn't cuss man
Roll with the loc'd out homies though
We ran the streets
And on the scene at the age of fourteen, huh
I stayed strapped reminiscin' back in 85
A little shorty drinkin' 40's livin naughty lives
They couldn't stop us
We runnin' round corners from the coppers
Jumpin' over fences in defense of the helicopers
I wasn't much of the school type
I was a fool
I'm breakin' all the rules on a school night
Tonight'll be the night that's what we thinkin'
Hustlin' in the rain felt no pain cause we drinkin'
And them days we was all for one
You gotta sracp with us all if you wanna brawl with one
Just two brothers comin' up out the hood
Livin' life just as good as we could
But since a trick can't be trusted
Caught her snitched to the police
Now my homies busted
The cops whoopin' on a brother in jail
Tryna to get a real player to tell
But couldn't nobody diss my homie
For all the brother's locked up and lonely
Pour out a little liquor!

[Hook]
Y'all know what time it is
Pour out a little liquor!
Tip that glass over
I don't care if it's Nitrate of Champagne
Pour out a little liquor!
Pay out respect for those who's gone but not forgotten
Y'all still here
Pour out a little liquor!
Pour out a little liquor!

[Verse 2]
Drinkin' champagne
To take away the pain it's strong
I'm reminiscin' bout my homies
That's dead and gone
And though I'm worried
Sometimes my eyes still get blurry
Cause I'm losin' all my homies in a hurry
I got my back against a brick wall trapped in a circle
Boxin' with them suckers till my knuckles turn purple
Mama told me
Son there'll be days like this
Don't wanna think so
I hit the drink and stay blitzed
We had plans of bein big time G's
Rolling in mob, switches and gold keys
Roll up the window
Blaze up the indo
Get to' down for my homies in the pen yo
Your son's gettin big and strong
And I'd love him like one of my own
Till you come home and
The years sure fly with the quickness
You do the time
And I'll keep handlin' your business
I hope my words can paint a perfect picture
And let ya know how much a brother miss ya
Uh
Pour out some liquor!

[Hook]
Ayyy
Pour out a little liquor!
Y'all know what time it is
Pour out some liquor!

Pour out a little liquor!</pre>
