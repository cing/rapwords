Artist: 2Pac w/ Digital Underground *
Album:  Me Against the World
Song:   Fuck the World
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

* Shock G sings the parts in {} throughout

[2Pac]
Haha, what you say?
Who you callin rapist?  Ain't that a bitch
You devils, are so two faceted
Wanna see me locked in chains, dropped in shame
and gettin stalked by these crooked cops a-gain
Fuckin with the young black male, tryin to stack mail
and umm, stay away from the packed jails
I told the judge I'm in danger
and that's why I had that fo'-five with one in the chamber
Fuck the world!

Chorus: 2Pac

{They tryin to say that I don't care}
I woke up screamin, "Fuck the world!"
{They tryin to say that I don't care}
Just woke up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"
{They tryin to say that I don't care}
Uhh, I woke up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"
{They're tryin to say that I don't care}
Just got up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"

[2Pac]
When I was comin up rough that wasn't even what you called it
That's why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
I'm gettin, threats to me, comin from my enemies
And, in they dreams it's, Hell where they sendin me
Have I, lost control or just another soul
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Sippin on yak as I sit back (YES!) life as a big mack
Brothers come up and say, "You did that?" {uhh, uhh, uhh}
Never take yo' eyes off the prize, and even if you gettin high
don't ever hesitate to try
Cause you can fall off or stay ballin, niggaz we all in
And them my motherfuckers callin {ohh, ohh, ohh}
Fuck the world!

Chorus: 2Pac

{They tryin to say that I don't care}
I woke up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"
{They tryin to say that I don't care}
Just woke up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"
{They tryin to say that I don't care}
I got up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"
{They tryin to say that I don't care}
I woke up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"
{They tryin to say that I don't care}

[2Pac]
Man, fuck the world..
Damn, they wanna label me a menace
cause I'm sittin here sippin on Guinness
Weighin 165, and these tricks should die
for bein jealous of a brother when he rides
I can see it in yo' eyes, you wanna see a young playa fallin
They hate to see a nigga ballin
Some of you suckers is rottin, plottin on what I got
And then you wonder why I shot him (boo-ya!)
Stop givin game for free, you wanna hang with me
like being a thug is the thang to be?
But I got love for my homies, the G's and macks
And if you're black, you better stay strapped
Nigga, fuck the world!

Chorus: 2Pac

{They tryin to say that I don't care}
I woke up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"
{They try to say that I don't care}
I woke up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"
{They tryin to say that I don't care}
Got up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"

Haha, fuck the world!  Fuck it
I hear my niggaz screamin fuck the world!

[2Pac]
They wanna know if I claim the click, that I'm hangin with
and if I'm down with this bangin shit
Well homie I don't give a fuck if you Blood or Cuz
Long as ya got love for thugs
But don't try to test me out, stall that
Homie this is Thug Life nigga and we all strapped
I been through, Hell and back, and if I, fell black
then it's, back to the corner where we sell crack
Some of you niggaz is bustas; you runnin 'round 
with these tramp=ass bitches, don't trust her
But don't cry, this world ain't prepared for us
A straight thug motherfucker who ain't scared to bust
Fuck the world!

Chorus: 2Pac [Humpty Hump/Shock G]

{They tryin to say that I don't care}
I woke up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"
{They're tryin to say that I don't care}
I woke up screamin, "Fuck the world!" [Uhh!]
{They tryin to say that I don't care}
[They tryin to say that I don't care]
I woke up screamin, "Fuck the world!"
[Yeah what's goin on y'all?]
[Uhh, uhh, uhh..] Fuck the world!

[Shock G * singing *]
I don't care.. I don't care, I don't care! {fades}</pre>
