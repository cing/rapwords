Artist: 2Pac
Album:  All Eyez On Me
Song:   Wonder Why They Call U
Typed by: OHHLA.com

Chorus: 2Pac
 
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch.
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch.
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch.

Verse One: 2Pac
 
Look here Miss Thang
hate to salt your game
but yous a money hungry woman
and you need to change.
 
In tha locker room
all the homies do is laugh.
High five's cuz anotha nigga 
played your ass.
 
It was said you were sleeezy
even easy
sleepin around for what 
you need
 
See it's your thang 
and you can shake it how you wanna.
Give it up free 
or make your money on the corner.
 
But don't be bad and play the game
get mad and change.
Then you wonda why these muthafuckas
call you names.
 
Still lookin' for a way out
and that's OK 
I can see you wanna stray
there's a way out.
 
Keep your mind on your money,
enroll in school.
And as the years pass by 
you can show them fools.
 
But you ain't tryin' to hear me
cuz your stuck,
you're headin' for the bathroom
'bout to get tossed up.

Still lookin' for a rich man
you dug a ditch,
got your legs up
tryin' to get rich.

I love you like a sista 
but you need to switch
and that's why they called
U bitch, I betcha.
 
Chorus

Verse Two: 2Pac
 
You leave your kids with your mama
cuz your headin' for the club
in a skin tight miniskirt
lookin' for some love.
 
Got them legs wide open 
while you're sittin' at the bar
Talkin' to some nigga 
'bout his car.
 
I guess he said he 
had a Lexxxus, what's next?
You headin' to his car for some sex
 
I pass by
can't hold back tears inside
cuz, lord knows
for years I tried.
 
And all the other people
on my block hate your guts
Then you wonda why they stare
and call you slut.

It's like your mind don't understand
you don't have to kill your
dreams ploten'
schemes on a man

Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin' 
I'm hearin' rumors so you need to switch 
and niggas wouldn't call you bitch, I betcha.

Chorus
 
Verse Three: 2Pac

I guess times gettin' hard
even harder for you
cuz, hey now, got a baby
on the way now

More money from the county
and thanks to the welfare
you're about to
get your hair done.

Got a dinner date 
can't be late
trick or treat, sweet thang
got anotha trick to meet.

The way he did it
it was smooth
plottin' while he gamin' you
So baby, peep tha rules.

I shoulda seen it in the first case
the worst case
I shoulda never called you back 
in the first place.
 
I remember back in high school
baby you was fast 
straight sex
and barely move your ass.
 
But now things change
cuz you don't look the same
let the ghetto get the best of you
baby, that's a shame
 
Caught HIV and now you 'bout to be deceased
and finally be in peace.
 
So where your niggas at now
cuz everybody left
they stepped 
and left you on your own
 
See I loved you like a sista
but you died to quick
And that's why we called U bitch, I betcha.
 
Chorus

Outro: 2Pac

Dear Ms. Deloris Tucker
keep stressen me
fuckin' with a muthafucken mind
I figured you wanted to know
you know
why we call them hos bitches
and maybe this might help you understand
it ain't personal
strictly business baby
strictly business

So If you wonder why we call U bitch
You wonder why we call U bitch
If you wonder why we call U bitch
You wonder why we call U bitch</pre>
