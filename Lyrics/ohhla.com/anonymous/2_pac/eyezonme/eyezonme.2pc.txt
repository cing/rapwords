Artist: 2Pac f/ Syke
Album:  All Eyez On Me
Song:   All Eyez On Me
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

['Pac talking]
Big Syke, Newt, Hank
Beugard, Big Sur (yeah)
Y'all know how this shit go (y'know)
	{All Eyez On Me}
Motherfuckin O.G. 
Roll up in the club and shit (is that right?)
	{All Eyez On Me}
	{All Eyez On Me}
But you know what?

[2Pac]
I bet you got it twisted you don't know who to trust
So many playa hating niggaz tryin to sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin
Straight to the depths of hell is where those cowards goin
Well are you still down nigga?  Holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggaz every time we ride (every time we ride)
Hittin motherfuckers up when we pass by (when we pass by)
Until I die; live the life of a boss playa
Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes, cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-oh - Benz flauntin flashy rings, uhh
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been know to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems - my main thang was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin jealous, and motherfuckers died
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got foe niggaz, and lowriders, in ski masks
screamin Thug Life every time they pass {All Eyez On Me}

Chorus One: 2Pac

Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
live the life of a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}
cause even gettin high.. ..{All Eyez On Me}
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
live the life of a boss playa, cause even gettin high..

[Syke]
Heeyyy, to my nigga 'Pac..
So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin everyday, times moving faaast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman, and my pistol, and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm takin off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tec
Devoted to servin this, Moet and paaayyy-checks
Like Akai satellite nigga I'm forever ballin
It ain't right parasites triggers and fleas crawlin
Sucker duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin my business nigga keep on coastin
Where you goin I been there came back as lonely homie
Steady flowin against the grain niggaz STILL don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny niggaz don't even know how to act - shit!
What can I do, what can I say, is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, twenty-fo' parlay
My little homie G, can't you see, I'm busta free
Niggaz can't stand me - all eyes on me!

Chorus Two: 2Pac

I live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}
cause even gettin high {All Eyez On Me}
I live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}
cause even gettin high

[2Pac]
The feds is watchin, niggaz plottin to get me
Will I survive, will I die?  Come on let's picture the possibility
Givin me charges, lawyers makin a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong, and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile callin big shots on the scene major
Packing hundreds in my drawers; fuck the law
Bitches I fuck with a passion, I'm livin rough and raw
Catchin cases at a fast rate, ballin in the fast lane
Hustle til the mornin, never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live my life as a boss playa, cause even gettin high 
these niggaz got me tossin shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz burnin rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is fully strapped
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with the bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket
Get your money motherfucker let's get rich and we'll kick it
All eyes on me!

Chorus Three: 2Pac

I live the life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}
cause even gettin high.. ..{All Eyez On Me}
I live the life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}
cause even gettin high.. ..{All Eyez On Me}

['Pac talking]
Pay attention my niggaz
See how that shit go?  Nigga walk up in this motherfucker

Cops.. bitches.. everymotherfuckinbody
	[* overlap *]
	Live my life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
