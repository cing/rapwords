Typed by: OHHLA.com

Intro: 2Pac

Aight, new drink 
one part alazhay one part chrystal
Thugs Passion baby
y'all know what time it is
This drink is Gauranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
now if ya with me
Pour a glass and drink with a nigga 
know what I mean ?
I ain't trying to turn you all niggas into alcholics
Alcholics [ha ha]
I'm just trying to turn you into muthafuckin thugs
So come and get some of this thug passion Baby

Verse One: Dramacydal

I could pull out the drink
and be good 'till it's relavent but
I'm a straight solider, I'll roll up a nigga
like its Heaven sent
Tripping over dead presidents
they got these derelicts
I throw was down with this business
Tryin' clown and get a cent 
and so rather
than stand forever, been thinking
drinking over a felony 
and hell of me and how it will be some other shit
People telling me to cool out 
But they ain't feeling me
a mutha fuckin fool 'bout
my fuckin cheddar cheese
and it pleases, passion of mine
Thuggin huggin plenty of G's 
and laughing while I pass through times
And all thes back stabbers be watchin
Just keep it plain
I'm a keep it the same partner
Just take it the simple game
I can pinkle with the rain twinkling
diamonds and thangs go plinklin
enough to hold me, til' I'm, old and wrinklin
and These adversaries
they gonna have to be worrying
cuz I'm a be illing 
Fufillin my Passion
Till I'm burryin'
My Thug Passion

Chorus: Jewell

I heard it's the bomb
and you got it going on
give me some of your Thug Passion Babby
You got me dripping wet
from the way you make me sweat
give me some of your Thug Passion Babby
owwowwwowwww

Verse Two: Dramacydal

Now what if me
turn this Henessee
into a robbery
the Prophecy probably suddenly 
switch and How it supposed to be?
And Dirty money
Can't be evil cuz it's filling up my tummy see
Born in a position
Death collision
was futuristic
twisting riches
But there is only one way to make mo'
so I'm standing on the corner 
trying to hustle in the snow
and My bigga bro
couldn't know
but buy a four four 
blasting at playa hating 
wantin' mo'
with a Thug Passion

Verse Three: 2Pac

Putting down mashin'
control by this Thug's Passion
unlike them other bustas pistol blastin'
I'm asking, What Happened?
To the niggas who kept it real
like they claim to
that's when I bang do
see thang true
Traveling this road my poor soul
has been consolidated
with all this bullshit I done tolerated
How I made it
can easily stated
it's like my heart be gripped with the Passion
to be the fucking greatest
Load up and take shit

(Dramacydal)

Make this to some high dollar gangster shit
jack a stack till we got enought bank to split

Verse Four: Storm

Creep with me
through that Imortal flow
Thug Passion got you tremblin'
like Death on the Row
make your move
so I can throw your mind a curve
while i'll be blowin up tha scene
like my nigga Mr. Herb
take a toke
as your heart goes full arrest
I got tha bomb
so nigga, fuck tha rest
ya need a 3rd to get ya flowin'
and let that loc see smoke
feelin' tha strokes of tha nine squeeze tight and slow

Chorus

Verse Five: 2Pac

They say money don't make tha man
but damn i'm makin' money
observin' you muthafuckers
cause some of you bitches funny
say you want it
but you bullshitin'
lickin' them lips
you got me about to act a fool quick
sippin' on some Alazay and Cristal, meanwhile
buy me a drink
and get to winking at me
she smiles
a niggas full of passion
Satisfaction is everlastin'
How does it feel  ?
what i'm askin'
while i'm rubbin' on that ass
why you laughin' ?
see, i'm diggin' as if i'm curious
full blown and furious
baby get a grip
when I be doin' this
It's so physical
my attraction
driven by alchol 
beware of my reaction
baby i'm born to ball
thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize
and picture what I said so
Now you can feel it
it's a potion for my niggas in motion
forever blastin'
bitches ain't ready for this Thug Passion

Chorus 4X</pre>
