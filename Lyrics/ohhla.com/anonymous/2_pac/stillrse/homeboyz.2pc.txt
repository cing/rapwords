[2Pac]
Oh shit, caught that nigga alone
Ain't that a bitch
Hey, uh, this one here is, uhh
for them niggaz that be Johnny Dangerous when they be fuckin fifty deep
But they be fuckin cowards when they by theyselves
You know who I'm talkin about
(You know who I'm talkin about) that's right
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys

Now
Now everytime I see you cats is rollin in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep
out on the streets you don't hear a peep
Nigga it's a god damn shame, somebody explain 
why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street but you'll be sleepin in the casket
How long will it last, nigga don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash tryin to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate 
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggaz aimin at my head but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck motherfuckers I'm loc
They all duckin when my gun smoke
cause you ain't shit without your homeboys
You probably run at the sound of funk
I give a fuck, you niggaz is punks
Without your homeboys, you be the first to reach in your trunk
You scary niggaz is punks, you ain't shit without your homeboys
Nigga, punk ass motherfucker
You ain't shit without your homeboys
Throw your hands up you little trick, coward motherfucker

[Young Noble]
Like Yak said, how the fuck you gonna shoot me rocks
When you got the Outlaw 'Pac shittin ya box
You was lookin real weak walkin down the street
Now a nigga thirty deep, oh you wanna beef
Talk cheap, shoot a nigga the fair one
Your homies like fuck it, what's this you the only scared one
(faggot ass) Damn son, close call I bet
Now down around the way you gets no respect
They like that Outlaw nigga played you out
We could have took it to the firfth I would I have laid you out
Niggaz be actin all different when they dogs come around
Watch em act like bitches when Outlawz draw down
They all clown, better yet they all stunned 
You the type to have a gun and never blazed it once
Get y'all banana split, you ain't Emmanuel
Outlawz you'll never forget
Makaveli the Don get a call y'all
Turnin these streets into Vietnam
Where your homeboys, homeboy

[2Pac]
You ain't shit without your homeboys
My thug niggaz, I love niggaz
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
My homeboys, the only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggaz to death, we ain't shit without our homeboys
.. You know what time it is
I ain't shit without my homeboys
Hey, tell em the story how you came up nigga

Now I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggaz is so close, it's complicated
One nigga smokin and drinkin, and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggaz cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherfuckers they all die
Been tryin to make a million, by hustlin since my adolescense
From crack dealin to rap villian, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me
Bustin with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
Niggaz fiendin, I got em comin back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah
Forever, my niggaz be together

Ain't shit without your homeboys
Thug niggaz I love niggaz
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
Without your homeboys, the only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggaz to death
We ain't shit without our homeboys
(without our homeboys)
Love my niggaz to death
We ain't shit without our homeboys
Love you niggaz to death</pre>
