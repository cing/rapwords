Artist: 2Pac f/ Amel Larrieux
Album:  Best of 2Pac Pt. 1 - Thug
Song:   Resist the Temptation
Typed by DJ: critikaL, chaloveli@gmail.com

[2Pac: Intro]
Resist the temptation
This song go out to the Underground Railround..
Digital Underground..

[2Pac: Verse 1]
Resist the temptation of the beast
You slip and loose your grip and forever fall asleep
The venom is contagious, be wary of its spell
What you thought would be heaven, turns out to be hell
I wonder if she knows, the devil's taking off her clothes
Deep into her soul, slow, now he's in control
Poppa's doing worse, a victim of his deadly curse
Wouldn't be the first, to leave the ghetto in a hearse
Oh and how it hurts, the children pay the biggest price
Never get the chance, to grow up with a happy life
Blame it on the rock, but we know that's a bunch of crap
Someone from the top, supplying us with plenty crack
Keep 'em in a daze, don't let them see the other way
Let 'em all get paid, won't live to see another day
See they never got a breath of the sunshine
Now the kid's addicted and only hit it one time
We're destined to be dead as a nation
Don't let it come to this, resist the temptation

[Amel Larrieux: Chorus]
From, pyramid top to, bottom of bowl
From, whips and lock your fist and afro
We, dug too deep to give up this gold
Don't beat boy, and you won't be sold
Running on empty, you ain't gon' go
Running on empty, lead you to nowhere
We fact, nobody can lie
So: RE, SIST, THE, TEMPTATION

[2Pac: Verse 2]
Gamble for your soul with the devil
You wonder how low, can you go, before you finally reach the lowest level
As everybody sit and stares
There's no use looking in your eyes 'cause there isn't anybody there
And though it may make you wanna cry
Got you stealing from your family and you don't even know why
I guess you think they'll understand
You feel cold, 'cause you sold your soul to the dopeman
Oh now there's no turning back, in fact
I's decided, that would live and die for the crack
You got no friends cause you cheated 'em all
Feel lonely, low, defeated and small
No one was there when I took the wrong path
And nobody'd care if I died in a blood bath
But is this my destiny?
Tell the lord they got my mind, but he can have the rest of me
Cause I'm ready to end it all
One bullet to the brain, forgive my sins and all
I didn't mean to be a bother
A failure as a son, a husband and a father
I wish I could turn back the time
Go back and find, why I let it crack my mind
And my only explanation, it came to this
Resist the temptation

[Amel Larrieux: Chorus]
From, pyramid top to, bottom of bowl
From, whips and lock your fist and afro
We, dug too deep to give up this gold
Don't beat boy, and you won't be sold
Running on empty, you ain't gon' go
Running on empty, lead you to nowhere
We fact, nobody can lie
So: RE, SIST, THE, TEMPTATION

[2Pac: Verse 3]
Your death left family behind
Your wife and your son find a gun, and pieces of daddy's mind
On the door and on the floor
Now her husband is dead, what else is she living for?
So now she picks up the gun
Now son is the only one
Grows up in adoption homes
Gets older, bolder, and cold 'cause he's left alone
To him, nothing is funny
Mind set on one thing, making his money
Since I was left with no hope
I want money and gold ropes and so I slang dope
Now I'm the neighborhood dopeman
And as long 'cause they smoking I'll never be broke man
I live the life of a trifle
Following a cycle, so I'm just a psycho
But if I had a better life
I would have lived a good life and did more things right
Hard to resist temptation
With all the aggravation and the frustration
Of living in the ghetto
Your mind gets twisted, just like a pretzel
So it's time that I check out
But one nosy cop, just won't let me get out
They got me trapped once again
With a choice: shoot the cop, or live life in the pen
I can't stand the frustration
Resist the temptation

[Amel Larrieux: Chorus w/ extra ad-libs]
From, pyramid top to, bottom of bowl
From, whips and lock your fist and afro
We, dug too deep to give up this gold
Don't beat boy, and you won't be sold (resist the temptation)
Running on empty, you ain't gon' go
Running on empty, lead you to nowhere
We fact, nobody can lie
So: RE, SIST, THE, TEMPTATION

[2Pac: Outro w/ Amel Larrieux ad-libs]
