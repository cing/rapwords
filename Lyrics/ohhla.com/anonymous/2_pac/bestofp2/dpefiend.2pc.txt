Artist: 2Pac
Album:  Best of 2Pac Pt. 2 - Life
Song:   Dopefiend's Diner
Typed by: exlax_max@hotmail.com

[Verse 1]
Late night coolin' with my homies
drinkin' Hennessey and cold brew
After smokin', stopped in Oakland
got the munchies for some soul food
So we stopped to get a bite to eat
at the local bar-b-q
It's just another boring Monday
and there's nothing else to do
Now as we stepped out of the car
I heard someone behind me fighting
So I turn to look and find out
what's the cause of this excitement
The brother was a dopefiend
and the other was a dopeman
and the dope man had an AK
said he'll spray and he's not jokin'
Well it seems to be the dopefiend
owed the dope man for his product
And he swore if he did not pay
he would end up getting shot up
Now I could not walk away
cause I got caught up in the scene
Wondering what would happen to this
poor and helpless fiend
Well my homie, Michael Cooley
said let's go and make our order
What's the use in watchin' two men
stand out here fight over quarters
While I walked inside the diner
and all the Dope Fiends waived to me
Heard the sound of several gun shots
and I ran outside to see... (What's Going On?)

[Chorus]
Another gun shot rings (What's Going On?)
Another siren sings (What's Going On?)
Another mother cries (Yo what's Going On?)
Cause another innocent died (Yo what's Going On?)

Another gun shot rings (What's Going On?)
Another siren sings (What's Going On?)
Another mother cries (Yo what's Going On?)
Cause another innocent died

[Verse 2]
All the people in the diner
ran outside to see the big show
It was just another party
for them to see just who they would know
but for me I held concern
I wanted to see the outcome
Would the mother see her son tonight
or would she live her life without one?
I made it to the streets I
almost cried right on the spot
Not only had the fiend died
but a small girl had been shot
My heart could take no more
I felt a tear roll down my face
That was daddy's bullet
but she took it in his place

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Tried to make my way through the crowd
so I could go help the baby
She could barely speak
but she whispered
Mister could you please save me
So I screamed out, someone help me
but I dont think they could hear
and if they did, they didn't care
Oh how I hated everyone there
The baby lie here dying
and I wondered what could I do
The camera men and newspapers had come
to get their interviews
To them it's just a story
and they can't see the tragedy
To them it doesn't matter
cause it ain't it wasn't their family
I don't think I'll be back
cause it'll never be the same here
So I wipe away the tears
and leave the scene the way I came here
Though some people say it's crazy
and the food could have been finer
I'll never forget, never forget the night
at Dopefiend's Diner

[Chorus]

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do... (Repeats until song fades out)</pre>
